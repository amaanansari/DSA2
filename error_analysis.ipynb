She also believed that she was meant to get the part because the character was originally called Daisy, a nickname her boyfriend and friends call her. Hampele made her first screen appearance as Georgia during the episode broadcast on 5 October 2012. Hampele decided to leave the show in 2015 to pursue new acting opportunities, and Georgia made her departure in the same month.

This is clearly demonstrated in Hurricane Advisories #15 through #41, which can be viewed at the following link. The Birmingham National Weather Service\\'s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\"\\n\\nThat statement is technically correct.

The plaintiffs, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and The Ordinary People Society allege that the defendants, President Donald Trump, the Vice President Michael Pence, and Kris Kobach are in violation of the Fifth and Fifteenth Amendments and the Federal Advisory Committee Act by establishing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity(PEIC) for the purpose of supporting the President’s claim that \"Voter fraud is all too common and then they criticize us for saying that ... take a look at Philadelphia, what\\\\\\'s going on, take a look at Chicago, take a look at St. Louis.\"\\', \"Trump Tower wiretapping allegations | On March 4, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump wrote a series of posts on his Twitter account that accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones at his Trump Tower office late in the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump presented no evidence for his claim but called for a congressional investigation. The Trump administration later stated that reports from various news sources supported Trump\\'s claim, although none of these reports explicitly gave credence to Trump\\'s allegation.\", \\'Effects of Hurricane Dennis in Alabama | The Effects of Hurricane Dennis in Alabama, USA included $127 million (2005 USD) in damage and three injuries. Dennis made landfall on the Florida Panhandle as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 10, 2005, before tracking over Alabama as a minimal hurricane. In preparation for the storm, about 500,000 people were given evacuation orders, and the Red Cross opened 87 shelters. As a result, all southbound lanes of Interstate 65 from Mobile to Montgomery were closed.\\', \"Hurricane Frederic | Hurricane Frederic was an intense and damaging tropical cyclone that carved a path of damage from the Lesser Antilles to Quebec, in particular devastating areas of the United States Gulf Coast. Though only five were killed directly, the US$2.3 billion in damage accrued by Frederic made it the Atlantic basin\\'s costliest tropical cyclone on record at the time. Prior to its final landfall, the threat that Frederic imposed on areas of the U.S. Gulf Coast triggered a mass exodus from the region larger than any other evacuation in the past. While the storm primarily impacted the U.S. states of Mississippi and Alabama, lesser effects were felt throughout the Greater and Lesser Antilles, as well as inland North America.\", \\'Effects of Hurricane Isaac in Florida | The Effects of Hurricane Isaac in Florida were severe local flooding in South Florida and tornadoes in the central and northern portions of the state in August 2012. Hurricane Isaac formed from a tropical wave while located east of the Lesser Antilles on August 21, 2012. The storm moved westward, crossed through the Leeward Islands, and entered the Caribbean Sea on August 22. Isaac initially struggled to intensify and defied predictions of it strengthening into a hurricane. The storm made its first landfall in Haiti as a midgrade tropical storm prior to making a second one in Cuba later that day. It remained somewhat disorganized while moving through the Straits of Florida and passed near the Florida Keys on August 27. The storm threatened to strike the Tampa Bay Area during the 2012 Republican National Convention and move ashore in the Florida Panhandle as a major hurricane. However, it continued northwestward and avoided landfall in the state. The storm finally became a hurricane late on August 28. Isaac made two landfalls in Louisiana on August 29, the first near the mouth of the Mississippi River and the other near Port Fourchon. The storm steadily weakened and eventually dissipated over Missouri on September 1.\\']'"
