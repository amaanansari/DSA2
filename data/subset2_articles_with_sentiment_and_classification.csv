In a new interview with Harper’s Bazaar, Stewart said that, before she became an established star, she had “fully been told, ‘If you just, like, do yourself a favour, and don’t go out holding your girlfriend’s hand in public, you might get a Marvel movie.’” She added: “I don’t want to work with people like that.”

Stewart had been talking to the interviewer about why she felt more able to respond to the media and film audience’s interest in her sexuality. “I was informed by an old-school mentality, which is: you want to preserve your career and your success and your productivity, and there are people in the world who don’t like you, and they don’t like that you date girls, and they don’t like that you don’t identify as a quote-unquote ‘lesbian’, but you also don’t identify as a quote-unquote ‘heterosexual’. And people like to know stuff, so what the f*** are you?

“I just think we’re all kind of getting to a place where – I don’t know, evolution’s a weird thing – we’re all becoming incredibly ambiguous. And it’s this really gorgeous thing.”

A Minnesota woman was attacked and killed by a black bear in what officials are calling a rare incident.

Catherine Sweatt-Mueller, 62, was staying with her parents Sunday on their secluded, family-owned island, Red Pine Island, on Rainy Lake in Ontario, Canada. Sweatt-Mueller noticed her two dogs barking strangely, so she went out to check on them, Ontario Provincial Police Constable Jim Davis told CNN.

The dogs came back to the cabin, one injured and bloody, he said. But Sweatt-Mueller didn’t return, prompting her mother to call 911.

Officers got the call at 6:30 p.m. local time, but it took them 30 minutes to get to the remote island by boat, then another 45 minutes to locate Sweatt-Mueller because of the wooded terrain, Davis said.

When they found her, about 330 yards from the cabin, a black bear was standing over her body, he said. She was declared dead on the scene.

Police fatally shot that black bear, Davis said, before two other black bears – one stomping its feet, snorting and smacking its lips and another working its way around a perimeter – soon took off.

These kinds of attacks are rare, Davis said. In his 11 years as a police officer, he’d never heard of anything like it happening.

“It’s a fairly unique situation and not an everyday occurrence,” he said. “Definitely a one-off.”

In the 110 years starting in 1900, at least 63 people were killed by black bears in 59 incidents in the US and Canada, according to a 2011 study.

The slain bear will undergo anecropsy at the University of Guelph. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry is searching for the other two black bears, it said in a statement.",-0.089,0.392,0.109,0.869,0.021,-0.9791,True,"This article appears to be a factual report of a rare black bear attack on a woman in Canada.

Olsen's book examines the most plausible explanation of the unlikely dual attacks since no fatal grizzly attack had ever been recorded in the park's 57-year history prior to that night. One specialist at the time calculated the odds were greater than 1 in a million for a single attack but the odds of two separate attacks in a 4 hour time span were beyond measure.

Cheerleader Tyra Winters is Rockwall High School’s homecoming hero and it wasn’t for anything that happened on the field.

The 17-year-old senior was riding on a float in the homecoming parade when she saw a desperate mother and a little boy who needed help.

“I see the kid. I see a little bright red face and his mom’s holding him up, begging for help, screaming, asking ‘someone help me someone help me,’ Winters told CNN affiliate KTVT.

She told the station that her first thought was “Oh my God, I’ve got to help this child.

“Her kid’s turning purple, so I immediately jumped off the float and I ran down to the kiddo and I said ‘I got him,’” Winters said.

She held the little boy and gave him three strong back thrusts that made him spit up the candy he was choking on.

Hornback told KTVT she was sitting right next to Clarke when it happened.

Fortunately, Winters had gotten CPR training in eighth grade because her mom is in the medical field. Winters plans to be a pediatric surgeon.

After watching Florida State wear down in Saturday's season-opening loss to Boise State, coach Willie Taggart is examining whether his players were properly hydrated.

On his weekly radio show Monday, Taggart said he has spoken with FSU's medical staff about better hydration after seeing several players cramp up in the game.

Florida State led 31-13 late in the third quarter before Boise State scored the game's final 23 points to win 36-31. Because of Hurricane Dorian, the game had been moved from an evening kickoff in Jacksonville to an early-afternoon kickoff at Florida State's Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee.

""They need to start hydrating early in the week and take care of their bodies,"" Taggart said on his call-in show. ""We can't leave it up to our players just to do it. We've got to force them to hydrate and take care of themselves. I don't know if we did a good job of that last weekend. One of those situations where you live and learn, and we'll make sure that we help our guys when it comes to that.""

Boise State ran 106 plays in the game, 46 more than Florida State, which had possession for only 19:57.

Earlier Tuesday, Florida State offensive lineman Baveon Johnson questioned the team's conditioning level, saying it ""wasn't our strong suit."" Johnson later said of the Boise State game, ""No, we weren't prepared. I wasn't prepared, we all weren't prepared.""

""I feel like it was just conditioning overall,"" he added. ""That's what we need to get better at.""

Kahn, the former head of the prop desk at Societe Generale, was given $300 million by the BlueCrest Capital founder and billionaire Platt in 2017 to start 111 Capital after more than 21 years at the French bank. Kahn's firm was allowed to run Platt's money for only the first 18 months, according to media reports at the time.

Millennium declined to comment, while Kahn and Platt could not be reached for comment.

Millennium, which notched returns of more than 7% through the end of August, has in the past couple years added big names, like Hutchin Hill founder Neil Chriss and the former Nomura and Barclays quant trader Derrick Li, to its quant roster.

Quants have been some of the most sought-after talent in the hedge-fund game, with managers battling not just one another for talent but also big-name Silicon Valley companies.

The decision for Kahn and his team to join a larger fund is discouraging news for hopeful hedge-fund founders, whom have found the appetite for new launches lacking.

Other small funds, like Samantha Greenberg's Margate Capital and Mark Fishman's Aesir Capital, have decided to close shop and join bigger managers — Citadel for Greenberg and ExodusPoint for Fishman — this year instead of operating without the scale and resources Millennium, Citadel, Exodus, and others can offer.

For over 10 years, the wildly popular game ""Minecraft"" has been a cultural juggernaut.

Despite other major games sweeping up millions of players, like ""Fortnite"" and ""Roblox,"" ""Minecraft"" continues to quietly dominate.

As of this week, the game now has over 112 million players every month.

That represents a jump of over over 20 million players since the last time Microsoft announced as much, back in October 2018 — an absolutely massive increase in players, considering the game has been available for over 10 years. The number includes players across game consoles, computers, mobile devices, and the education-focused version of the game.

Notably, ""Minecraft"" isn't free on the many platforms it's available on.

The tens of millions of new players ""Minecraft"" added in the last year all bought the game in one form or another, whether it was a direct purchase of a physical copy in a store or as part of Microsoft's popular Game Pass subscription service or a digital purchase.

Early success has persisted

The game has been a famously explosive phenomenon since early in its life; ""Minecraft"" started as a work-in-progress game, made by a single man (Markus ""Notch"" Persson). It had rudimentary graphics and controls. It was only available on PC. It was prone to breaking, because it was an unfinished game being made by a single person.

And yet, millions of people bought and played that early version of ""Minecraft.""

When Microsoft bought the game back in 2014 for $2.5 billion, the tech world was surprised and confused by the purchase.

But clearly that early success has persisted under Microsoft's care across the past five years.

""What we find is that it's a game that players keep coming back to,"" Helen Chiang, ""Minecraft"" studio head, told Business Insider in a phone interview this week. ""It may not always be the one that's in the forefront, because there are a lot of great games that continue to come out, but it's one that they love to return to.""

Why 'Minecraft' has been such a hit

So, why is ""Minecraft"" so popular?

We're talking about a game that looks like this:

Microsoft/Mojang

Think of ""Minecraft"" as virtual LEGO.

It's a system for fitting pieces together to create something — sometimes amazing somethings — from nothing. ""Minecraft"" provides endless building blocks and a blank canvas; it's up to you to create something incredible, or silly, or referential, or whatever else using the tools it provides. The tools are blessedly user-friendly, as are the systems for employing those tools.

So ruled a French judge on Thursday, rejecting a claim by neighbors on the southwestern island of Oléron that the fowl, named Maurice, was a nuisance and made too much noise.

The judge found that the rooster, being a rooster, had a right to crow in his rural habitat.

“Maurice has won his fight,” his lawyer, Julien Papineau, said after the court decision in the small coastal city of Rochefort. “The judge recalled that, where Maurice is singing, it is in nature. It is in a rural town.”

“This rooster was not being unbearable,” Mr. Papineau added. “He was just being himself.”

The court also awarded the rooster 1,000 euros, about $1,100, in damages — more than enough for a luxury redo of his simple green chicken coop, though the money will go to a fund for the families of those who have perished at sea, his lawyer said.

Ireland will suffer the biggest negative shock from a no-deal Brexit outside the UK, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has warned.

In its latest world economic health check, which warns of shrinking global growth amid a spike in trade tensions, the Paris-based think tank assesses the near-term impact of a no-deal Brexit.

It suggests that even with a relatively smooth adjustment, Irish economic growth will be cut by 1.5 per cent in 2020 and 2021, compared with 2 per cent in the UK itself.

Exports from the other EU economies to the UK are estimated to decline by about 16 per cent as a result of higher trade costs, with the largest effects being felt in Ireland.

The OECD said a no-deal exit would generate a large negative shock to the UK economy, pushing it into recession, while damaging growth prospects here.

The initial impact for both economies will be driven largely by “the trade and uncertainty shocks, but over time the adverse supply-side costs begin to emerge”, it said.

The impact on other EU member states will depend on the extent of their direct trade with the UK, their role in supply chains for exports to the UK and, over time, the extent to which they might be able to fill markets in which UK exporters have become less competitive.

The OECD said total export volumes (to all economies) are assumed to decline by 1.25 per cent in the EU economies as a whole in the near term, with the largest declines in Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Spain, reflecting the relative importance of the UK in their export markets.

The adverse effects on long-term supply could also be expected to raise the cost of government borrowing here, at least temporarily, reflecting market uncertainty about future growth prospects and policies, it said.

Smooth adjustment

The OECD said its assessment was predicated on there being a smooth adjustment, helped by the preparations made by the Irish and UK governments and the European Commission to limit the immediate disruptions to trade, financial markets and passenger movements.

However, it warned that “if preparations to Border infrastructure fail to prevent significant delays, or if financial market conditions were to deteriorate considerably, or if consumer confidence were to decline sharply, the near-term impact of a no-deal Brexit could be much more costly”.

In its wider report on the global economy, the OECD said the world’s leading economies needed to ease trade tensions and act decisively to prevent a descent into a low-growth trap from which it would be difficult to escape.

Labelling the economic outlook as “increasingly fragile and uncertain”, the Paris-based international organisation forecast that Britain would fall into recession if it left the EU without a deal, and euro zone growth would slow to close to zero.

Evidence is accumulating that the effects of trade tensions are greater than previously thought, the OECD said, urging all countries to stop erecting tit-for-tat trade barriers and to fight the economic slowdown with a fiscal stimulus, where public finances allowed.

The OECD downgraded the economic forecasts for almost all of the countries it examined, cutting its global growth projection for 2019 by 0.3 percentage points to 2.9 per cent, the weakest performance since the 2008-09 financial crisis.

Vicious circle

With little improvement foreseen in 2020 and big forecast downgrades, OECD chief economist Laurence Boone said: ""The danger is that we get into a vicious circle of lower trade, investment and higher uncertainty.""

She blamed multiple trade tensions, ranging from the US and China's battle over tariffs to the skirmishes between South Korea and Japan on crucial goods for technology supply chains and the US threats to impose tariffs on European car imports.

“The speed that trade tensions are materialising is worrying,” she said, adding that the effects “can be seen in how trade [volume] growth has collapsed.”

The forecasts suggest that US economic growth will slow from 2.9 per cent in 2018 to 2 per cent in 2020, Chinese growth will decline from 6.6 per cent to 5.7 per cent over the same period and the euro zone will see its growth rate almost halve from 1.9 per cent to 1 per cent.

“Collective effort is urgent to halt the build-up of trade-distorting tariffs and subsidies and to restore a transparent and predictable rules-based system that encourages businesses to invest,” the OECD said as it warned that companies would not want to invest in today’s uncertain climate. – Additional reporting: Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019",0.0106711525189786,0.3289855072463768,0.142,0.781,0.077,-0.9949,True,"This article appears to be a factual report on the economic implications of a no-deal Brexit, citing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as the source of the information.

He was 69.

Ms. Plame said the cause was organ failure.

Mr. Wilson’s decision to challenge Mr. Bush’s argument that Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi dictator, was secretly reconstituting his nuclear program changed both the narrative and the politics of the war. It forced the White House to concede, grudgingly, that Mr. Bush had built the case for the invasion of Iraq on a faulty intelligence report — one that critics said was cherry-picked to provide an urgent rationale for a war that quickly turned into a morass.

Mr. Wilson’s action ultimately created a rift between the White House and the Central Intelligence Agency and led to inquiries about whether intelligence had been politicized, a debate that racks Washington to this day. And the unmasking of Ms. Plame — who worked in the C.I.A. unit responsible for determining whether nations were building weapons of mass destruction — led to investigations and ultimately a trial for Vice President Dick Cheney’s top national security aide.

A big personality whom some found prickly and difficult, Mr. Wilson served in numerous posts, many in Africa, in a 23-year diplomatic career that began in 1976. One posting was to Niger, and in 2002, by then a private citizen, he was asked by the C.I.A. to return to that country to try to verify reports that Niger had sold uranium yellowcake to Iraq in the 1990s.

Hordes of dragonflies are showing up on weather radar and making things interesting for weather forecasters in the Eastern United States.

It’s not their fault – the flying insects are just heading south to escape the coming cold weather.

The National Weather Service office in Wakefield, Virginia, tweeted radar imagery on Monday that showed strange, cloud-like masses over parts of Virginia and North Carolina.

Dual polarization radar products argue otherwise and some of these returns are above 10,000ft 🤔 pic.twitter.com/ofE6cxsZIg — NWS Wakefield (@NWSWakefieldVA) September 16, 2019

Mike Dutter, the science and operations officer for the Wakefield office, said weather radar is sensitive enough to detect tiny droplets of rain, so it’s not unusual for it to also pick up dust, flocks of birds or insects.

“It doesn’t surprise me that we’re seeing this,” he said. “The thing that’s interesting is how widespread it is. It seems like numerous radars on the eastern third of the country are seeing it.”

Swarms of dragonflies were detected on radar last week over Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Entomologist MaLisa Spring, the the state coordinator of the Ohio Dragonfly Survey, said that there are still a lot of unanswered questions about dragonfly migrations, but several species do fly south in the late summer and early fall.

“We know dragonflies go south, but as far as we are aware, there is not one specific site where they hang out, but instead they seem to just spread out southward,” Spring said.

They will travel together in large groups when conditions are right.

Most of the dragonflies are Common Green Darners, she said, but several other species will also make the trip.

“This year, it seems like the numbers are much larger as a lot more people are reporting them,” Spring said.

Dragonflies only live a few months as adults, she said, so it will be up to future generations of the bugs to make the return trip north.",0.05508658008658,0.43921768707483,0.014,0.943,0.044,0.8141,True,"The article discusses how hordes of dragonflies are showing up on weather radar in the Eastern United States, specifically in Virginia and North Carolina.

Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight.

Rice, who represented Ireland at youth level and won three caps at senior level before switching to the country of his birth this year, is the latest high-profile player to be targeted with abuse on social media. The 20-year-old, who won his fourth England cap in Saturday’s 4-0 victory against Bulgaria in qualifying for Euro 2020, said that he has received messages about people going to his home and added that his parents were also targeted.

“I’ve had people saying they’re going to come to my house ... yeah online,” Rice said in an interview with ITV News. “There’s a few bits I could go into but I don’t need to go into it, threats to my family, threats to me. It was tough, there has been some abuse. It was more for my mum and dad really.”

Southgate said he had feared there would be a negative reaction towards Rice following the West Ham player’s decision to represent England. The manager said: “My concern with the transfer across associations was always the implications for him and his family. That’s why I thought it was a very sensitive subject and I didn’t want to push a decision because there was always going to be a reaction, but he has dealt all the way through, since his decision, with that really calmly, very maturely, and we have to hope that everything kind of passes on now.”

Southgate, who is considering replacing Marcus Rashford with Jadon Sancho when England host Kosovo at St Mary's this evening, added that the anonymity offered by social media is making abuse worse. ""I think the reality of being in the public eye is, whether it's through social media or other formats, people are subjected to abuse and I think people are naive if they don't realise that has happened for years,"" he said. ""But social media is clearly amplifying that and I think it's possible to have tighter controls. There is some responsibility for the companies involved to, for want of a better phrase, police that a little bit more strictly than they have.""

Jordan Henderson echoed calls by Rashford to force people to identify themselves when they create accounts on social media. ""I didn't realise people could just create accounts and you don't know who it is,"" the Liverpool midfielder said. ""I think that's one way forward. If someone could do something about that, that would be great and that would help.

“I think for the lads, they just need to be sensible with it and not read too much into it. I think it’s good to interact with the fans who support them, encourage them and want them to do well, but you’re also going to get people who are going to criticise you and you’ve just got to get on with it. Don’t read the comments.”

England have won their first three qualifiers in Group A and Southgate is likely to tweak his side against Kosovo, who have eight points from four games after beating the Czech Republic on Saturday. Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to replace Kieran Trippier at right-back and Sancho is in line to start alongside Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling in attack.

Sancho, who came off the bench for Sterling on Saturday, has been in scintillating form for Borussia Dortmund and Southgate wants to give opportunities to the 19-year-old. ""He's confident in his own ability,"" he said. ""I said when I named the squad, he's not a player we're looking to hold back. He's real competition. He's very diligent in his work, as well as the fact that he's exciting in his ability to beat people.""

The founders of Irish whiskey and gin producer West Cork Distillers are buying out the majority stake in the business held by the UK-based Halewood group for about €18 million.

The distillery, whose brands include a gin sold under the name of BBC star Graham Norton, has also secured capital from investment funds backed by the State, including €15 million from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF), for an expansion of the business. Jobs numbers at its Skibbereen base are set to grow by about 26 to more than 100.

Filings from West Cork Distillers show that Halewood is being bought out as part of a complex series of transactions.

The UK group’s shares are to be redeemed for €18 million. This will leave the distiller’s founders, former fishermen Denis McCarthy and Ger McCarthy and scientist John O’Connell, as majority shareholders, Mr O’Connell confirmed.

READ MORE

The total cost of the buyout and the planned subsequent expansion appear to be financed by a combination of fresh equity, debt financing and the restructuring of the balance sheet of West Cork Distillers to free up some of its reserves.

The company, which made a profit of €4 million in 2017 on sales of almost €20 million, plans to free up €20 million through a capital reduction. A further €6 million will be freed up by a restructuring of the balance sheet of a related company, Skibbereen Distilleries Holdings.

ISIF confirmed it will make an equity investment in the distillery to help finance its future expansion. The documents suggest that the buyout of Hale’s stake was a condition of the Irish taxpayer-backed investment.

International rollout

Separately, the ISIF-backed Irish Whiskey Growth Fund has also agreed to lend to the West Cork Distillery to fund its international rollout. This was not directly related to the Halewood deal.

Mr O’Connell confirmed that Halewood will retain ownership of the Pogues whiskey brand, which West Cork Distillers had produced. It also makes gin under the name of Graham Norton, the Cork-born BBC presenter.

He said the decision to buy out Halewood came because the UK company had, at one stage, put itself up for sale following the death of its founder. It is now off the market, but Mr O’Connell said West Cork Distillers did not want to leave its future “in the hands of someone else”.

‘Expand abroad’

“It has been a long, hard road to get to this point,” he said. “But now we are looking to expand the distillery and to expand abroad too.”

Despite an initial difficulty of procuring barley whisky owing to a high demand from illegal distilleries, by 1830 Teaninich produced 30 times more spirit than it did at its founding. At that point Munro sold the distillery to his younger brother Lieutenant-General John Munro. As an officer he spent most of his time in India, so he decided to rent the distillery out to Robert Pattison in 1850. The lease lasted to 1869 after which Munro leased it to John McGilchrist Ross. Ross relinquished the lease in 1895, and in 1898 Robert Innes Cameron took a stake in the distillery, and Munro and Cameron renovated and extended the distillery, investing £10,000 in to the renovations. In 1904 Cameron, who also owned stakes in Benrinnes, Linkwood and Tamdhu, took over the distillery completely. After Cameron died in 1933 the distillery was sold to Scottish Malt Distillers.

The San Francisco Board of Supervisors has unanimously approved a resolution this week declaring the National Rifle Association (NRA) a domestic terrorist organisation.

The legislative body within the government of the city and county of San Francisco in California has been unsettled by recent mass shootings across the nation.

The resolution was introduced by supervisor Catherine Stefani on July 30th, two days after a shooting at a garlic festival in Gilroy, California, in which three people were killed and more than a dozen injured.

Before the resolution was put to a vote Tuesday, Ms Stefani spoke about the ""carnage across this country,"" also citing mass shootings last month in El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, and near Odessa, Texas.

Ms Stefani said the NRA conspires to limit gun violence research, restrict gun violence data sharing and block every piece of sensible gun violence prevention legislation proposed at local, state and federal levels.

“The NRA exists to spread pro-gun propaganda and put weapons in the hands of those who would harm and terrorise us,” Ms Stefani said in a statement.

“Nobody has done more to fan the flames of gun violence than the NRA.” While the resolution has no practical effect, Ms Stefani said Wednesday, “I firmly believe that words matter, and I think this is a step in fighting the negative impact of the NRA.”

The NRA saw the action as a publicity stunt. “This is just another worthless and disgusting ‘sound-bite remedy’ to the violence epidemic gripping our nation,” Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the association, said in a statement Wednesday.

“This is a reckless assault on a law-abiding organisation, its members, and the freedoms they all stand for. We remain undeterred, guided by our values and belief in those who want to find real solutions to gun violence.”

The NRA also responded on Twitter, saying that it was “the fabric of American society” and “San Fran should be ashamed.” The post included a video of Wayne LaPierre, the organisation’s chief executive, calling on NRA members to stand up as Americans.

In a news release Wednesday, Ms Stefani referred to the federal justice department’s definition of terrorist activity, which involves the use of a firearm, weapon or dangerous device to endanger the safety of individuals. The definition also includes members of organisations that provide funds, weapons or training to individuals who commit terrorist acts.

The gun homicide rate in the United States is 25 times higher than any other high-income country and the gun ownership rate is two times higher, Ms Stefani said. With 393 million guns in this country, there are more guns than people, she added.

“Every country on Earth has video games, movies and mental health issues, and yet only the US has gun violence at elementary schools, at the movies, at Walmart,” Ms Stefani said. “The difference is guns. No other country has so many assault rifles on their streets.”

In August alone, 53 people died in mass shootings, including 22 in El Paso; nine in Dayton; and seven near Odessa.

The group worked closely with the organization Critical Resistance to see their plans come into action. The proposal by San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi was to construct a new $290 million jail in SF. The No New SF Jail Coalition fought against this proposal advocating that the current system was only at 65% capacity, the population in the jails was decreasing, and that the prisoners were reporting abuse by the sheriff’s deputy. The key goals of the Coalition were to prevent the expansion of jails in San Francisco, as the construction of a new jail does nothing to combat the real issue of mass incarceration.

The British prime minister Boris Johnson is to visit Dublin next Monday for a meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.

Mr Johnson is scheduled to meet Mr Varadkar for talks on Brexit and the North amid continuing political turmoil at Westminster and growing fears about a no-deal Brexit at the end of October.

A Government spokesman said he was “happy to confirm that the prime minister has accepted the Taoiseach’s invitation”.

However, the spokesman said that while the talks would cover a wide agenda, including Brexit, they would not be negotiations on the Northern Ireland backstop or the Border.

“We don’t negotiate bilaterally,” he said. The Government has consistently stressed that negotiations on Brexit take place between the UK and the EU27, for which Michel Barnier speaks.

Ministers had a lengthy discussion at Tuesday’s Cabinet meeting, which stretched into the late evening, about no-deal preparations.

The Government spokesman said Ministers discussed the increasing risk of a no-deal and there were contributions from a number of ministers about preparations in their own departments.

No deal planning was now “an absolute priority” across Government, he said.

The Government intends to launch a “call to action” to businesses as well as a public information campaign aimed at citizens to inform them about the consequences of a no-deal.

A number of exercises were also planned, the spokesman said. These would be “desktop exercises” which would “inform the approach to emergency crisis management” in the event of a no-deal.

Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe told his colleagues he will bring forward a memo in the coming weeks which would recommend if the budget should be prepared on the basis of a no-deal.

Officials said the agenda for the meeting with Mr Johnson was being finalised, though they were careful to make clear that there would be no negotiation of post-Brexit arrangements on the Border.

On Tuesday, Mr Johnson suggested that agri-food could continue to be regulated on an all-Ireland basis after Brexit, creating a regulatory barrier down the Irish Sea.

The prime minister told MPs that he would discuss the proposal with Mr Varadkar on Monday.

“We recognise that for reasons of geography and economics, agrifood is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland. We are ready to find ways forward that recognise this reality, provided it clearly enjoys the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest. We will also be discussing all this with the EU shortly and I will be discussing it with the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, when I see him in Dublin on Monday,” Mr Johnson said.

Mr Johnson’s government has not yet presented any proposals to the EU for alternatives to the Northern Ireland backstop for keeping the Border open after Brexit. But he told the House of Commons on Tuesday that workable alternatives were available.

“There are practical arrangements that we can find which avoid anyone putting infrastructure on the Irish border. These have been well worked out and involve measures such as trusted trader schemes, transit provisions, frontier zones, reduced bureaucracy for small and local traders, and many others,” he said.

These measures have been previously rejected by the EU as insufficient, and privately both EU and Irish officials are highly critical of the failure by the UK to bring forward concrete proposals, while insisting at Westminster that progress was being made in talks with Brussels.",0.0726608187134503,0.3635233918128656,0.053,0.884,0.063,-0.1128,True,"This news article appears to be factual, as it provides details about a scheduled meeting between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to discuss Brexit and Northern Ireland.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) district commander, Superintendent Gordon McCalmont, said his assessment was that the New IRA was responsible.

The bomb was “designed to kill and harm,” he said. “It was absolutely reckless, with a total disregard for our community.”

A member of the public discovered the “mortar-type device” on a wall in Church View - which overlooks Strabane police station - on Saturday. A number of homes were evacuated during the subsequent security operation.

Images released by the police appear to show three tubes taped together with wires coming out of them and resting on the front wall of a house, near the front door of the property.

Supt McCalmont said the fact that the device had been left “in a very unstable condition” close to residential homes was shocking.

“It astounds me,” he said. “My professional assessment was that for some reason it had failed to deploy, but it was there set up and ready to go.”

Those who left the device, he said, “had every intention of killing my colleagues,” and could easily have killed members of the public.

Hijacked

The control and design of the bomb, he said, was such that “it could have gone everywhere. There’s a house in the pathway which it would have had to cross, a domestic house, towards Strabane police station.

“It could have overshot into a domestic home.

“It was set there and it was sitting there overnight for approximately eight to nine hours in this every vulnerable position, only that a member of the public found it and allowed us to start putting a public safety operation in place.”

According to the police, the bomb was placed in a car which was hijacked from a pizza delivery driver in the Mount Sion area of Strabane at about 9.40pm on Friday.

A fake pizza order was placed from a phone box on Bridge Street and when the driver arrived at the address, his car was hijacked by three men.

It was found on fire at Evish Road about 45 minutes later. The device was found by a member of the public the following morning.

Aileen Mullan, who lives in Church View, told BBC Radio Foyle her children could have been killed.

“I thought what could have happened - it was right under my daughter’s bedroom window.

“My daughter is 14 and my son is seven. My son could have easily walked out the front door and lifted it, quite easily went out and lifted it and he would have been gone.”

Of the number of dissident republican groups in existence, the New IRA is viewed by police as posing the most significant threat in the north west of Northern Ireland.

It was responsible for the murder of 29-year-old journalist Lyra McKee in Derry in April. In January, it left a car bomb outside the city’s courthouse which exploded only minutes after a group of teenagers had walked past.

Its members have also killed two prison officers, and in 2017 attempted to kill a police officer by placing a bomb underneath his car outside his home.

Dissident republican groups have made a number of recent attempts to kill police officers in Northern Ireland.

Significant risks

Last month the Continuity IRA were blamed for a bomb on the Border at Wattle Bridge, Co Fermanagh, which detonated as police and members of the British army’s bomb disposal team were responding to reports of a hoax.

Supt McCalmont said that the police were “concerned as an organisation” about the increased number of attacks by dissident republicans.

“This is the seventh attack this year, of significance, and presents us real challenges in terms of delivering a policing service.

“The new IRA members behind this attack are living in our community. They are building bombs and storing weapons presenting significant risks to our community.”

While he was speaking to reporters in Derry on Monday, 80 police officers were involved in searches for bomb-making equipment in the Creggan area of the city.

“Our assessment is this group is concealing bomb-making materials in this area,” Supt McCalmont said.

The searches are related to New IRA activity, but are not connected to the discovery of the device in Strabane.

Supt McCalmont said his concern was the “level of recklessness” displayed by the New IRA and other dissident republican groups.

“We’re seeing devices left at bus stops in other parts of Northern Ireland, these devices left in a vulnerable position for extended periods of time.

“There’s absolute disregard for the community, the recklessness, it’s absolutely frightening the harm that could be presented to our community,” he said.

Asked if the New IRA was expanding its strength and capability, Supt McCalmont said that it was “difficult to say at this time” but that the PSNI believes they are trying to recruit new members.

He said the PSNI were not aligning the upsurge in dissident republican activity to Brexit. “We recognise the dissidents have spoken themselves, that they see it as a possible recruitment tool, but we’re not aligning this attack with the EU exit at this time.”

Supt McCalmont appealed for the public to contact the police with information, and said that their chances were “improved by support and information from the community.

“Our focus will remain on keeping the community safe against the threat posed by these violent groups,” he said. “I would strongly urge people to report any suspicions they have about dangerous or illegal activity in our community.”",-0.0082384510466702,0.4300346913360611,0.166,0.778,0.056,-0.9992,True,"This article appears to be factual, describing a specific incident where a mortar bomb was found in Strabane, Co Tyrone, and the subsequent investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

He was general manager of Belgium's most successful football club for some 15 years, until last year.

Earlier this week, two were held as part of the probe into the £13m (€18m) transfer of striker Aleksandar Mitrovic from Anderlecht to Newcastle in 2015.

It is understood Newcastle believe they are not directly connected to the case.

Belgian federal prosecutors said an arrest was made on Thursday morning in relation to the case, without providing a name.

However, sources close to the investigation told AFP and Reuters news agency that Mr Van Holsbeeck was the one detained.

Meanwhile, Mr Van Holsbeeck's lawyer told Belgian broadcaster RTBF he was not surprised at his client being questioned.

""It is logical that Herman Van Holsbeeck is heard after yesterday's arrests over various transfers. My client being one of those responsible for transfers at Anderlecht at the time, it is logical that he can explain himself on this transfer in particular,"" Daniel Spreutels told RTBF.

One of the people arrested this week was players' agent Christophe Henrotay, while the other was said to be an associate in Belgium.

The investigation centres on alleged illegal payments made as part of Mitrovic's moves from Partizan Belgrade to Anderlecht in 2013 and then from the Belgian side to Newcastle United, Belgian media reports say.

In April, Anderlecht premises were searched. No-one was detained at the time.

The bridge collapsed about 9:30 a.m. in Nanfangao, a tiny but often-crowded Pacific coast fishing village.

The weather at the time of the collapse was sunny, hours after a typhoon swept across parts of the island. Disaster relief officials would not say if the storm had weakened the bridge or give other details on the potential cause. Government-run Central News Agency said a bridge pier may have collapsed.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said she hoped all government departments would do everything possible to save people and ""keep the number of deaths and injuries as low as possible,"" CNA reported.

National Fire Agency spokesperson Su Hong-wei said the tanker's fall smashed three boats. It also set off a fire on the tanker truck but it did not spread beyond the vehicle.

Of the 10 people hospitalized, six were Filipinos and three were Indonesians, the agency said in a statement. People from both countries regularly work on fishing boats registered in Taiwan, where pay is better than in their home countries.

Typhoon Mitag had brought high winds and heavy rain to northern Taiwan on Monday night before moving northeast. Flights and ferry services had been canceled Monday.

The 460-feet Nanfangao Bridge is a tourist attraction in Yilan. It was opened in 1998 and was built to replace a lower bridge that prevented large fishing vessels from passing underneath.

According to the company that designed the nearly 60-feet-high bridge, MAA Consultants, it's the only single-span arch bridge in Taiwan supported by cables and the second single arch-cable steel bridge in the world.

President Donald Trump's abrupt reversals on how to handle the insurgent Taliban in Afghanistan has left the nation in disarray, as insurgents open new offensives in at least 10 of the country's 34 provinces.

By first planning a major reach-out to Taliban leaders — in the form of a contentious invitation to Camp David just before the 9/11 anniversary — then angrily rescinding it on Monday, Trump threw away the leverage he had, and more.

Years of direct talks over a US withdrawal of its 14,000 or so troops — initiated by the Obama administration and continued by Trump — had led to some optimism that a negotiated withdrawal could happen.

The hope was that it could reduce bloodshed while giving Afghan factions and the government a chance to reconcile, providing much-needed stability.

Instead, the bizarre sequence of events that ended with Trump canceling talks with the Taliban via a tweet has instead prompted a vow from them to press hard on attacks around the country.

The Taliban has also so far refused to speak with the US-backed Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani, whom they consider a puppet of foreign occupation.

It comes at a fractious time, as the country heads for a presidential election on September 28 that poses security, logistical and credibility problems for the government in the face of a looming and aggressive Taliban.

Fighting is an almost daily occurrence in at least 24 of the country's 34 provinces.

Ghani's government has already admitted that at least 2,000 of its 7,000 polling stations will be closed for the election because government forces cannot secure them, even with US help.

With the arrival of multiple offensives, at least half a dozen districts — units of territory often comprising hundreds of square miles — fell to the Taliban.

The action shows that the group and its leadership, which is mostly based in Quetta, Pakistan, can keep their grim promises.

Afghan officials Thursday admitted that Taliban forces were in control of districts in Takhar, Baghlan, Kunduz and Badakhshan provinces, in the north of the country, after a fresh round of attacks that followed Trump's cancellation of the negotiations.

In recent years the Taliban have very successfully disrupted government control in these northern areas, which lay far outside the traditional areas of Taliban influence in the south and east of the country.

Despite this apparent disadvantage, Taliban troops seized near-complete control of the major northern city of Kunduzm once in 2015 and again in 2018. Both times they ceded the city only in the face of heavy US air strikes. It has again been the target of attacks this summer.

Virtually no one argues that government forces would be capable of defending even these northern areas from Taliban attacks in the case of a US withdrawal, let alone maintain any control in the Taliban-dominated south.

The failure of Afghan security forces to maintain control without heavy US support had in part motivated the Trump administration to seek a withdrawal agreement.

Officials hope to avoid a bloody repeat of what the Soviet Union experienced in 1989, when its withdrawal prompted a ten-year civil war that eliminated all Soviet influence in just a few years.

That weakness by the central government has been repeated in the modern era, as Ghani is widely considered to be nearly powerless outside the capital of Kabul.

The one small political benefit for Ghani in the collapse of the talks is that he can campaign for reelection on September 28 without looking marginalized from a peace process steered by Trump and the Taliban.

The Kentucky Republican has promised a ""Grim Reaper"" strategy focused on burying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's legislative priorities, but without a robust GOP agenda it could prove unsatisfying for lawmakers facing restive voters ahead of 2020 elections. On Sunday, Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to the president asking for his ""urgent, personal intervention"" on gun violence.

""We implore you to seize this moment when your leadership and influence over the republicans in Congress on the issue of guns is so critical,"" they wrote.

President Trump has not fully explained what he would like to see Congress accomplish, particularly on gun control, and McConnell is reluctant to venture too far, beyond confirming the White House's administrative and judicial nominees.

That leaves big-ticket legislative victories highly unlikely as Pelosi's Democratic House churns out bills, the Republican Senate takes a pass, and the legislative calendar folds into campaign season.

""Senate Democrats must work to increase pressure on Leader McConnell to stop burying bills he doesn't like in his graveyard and to get the Senate working again,"" Schumer said in a letter to colleagues.

One test of voter mood will come in Tuesday's special election in North Carolina, where the Democrat for an open House seat, Marine veteran Dan McCready, faces Republican Dan Bishop, in a contest both parties see as toss-up. Mr. Trump is swooping in for a rally to push voters to the polls.

As legislating makes way for campaigning, Sarah Binder, a professor at George Washington University, said by email, ""The challenge for both parties though is that they really do need something to deliver to voters in 2020.""

Mr. Trump does want Congress to pass the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. And Congress needs to fund the government by the end of the month or risk another federal shutdown. But the president roiled talks by shifting $3.6 billion from military projects for the border wall and fallout continues over migrant detentions. Questions of impeachment hover.

Gun regulation, perhaps more than other issues, is putting pressure on the Senate to act.

August was bookended by devastating mass shootings across three cities that killed dozens and left scores more injured. Big business is stepping in to fill the void, with Walmart becoming the latest to announce limits on some ammunition sales. While a House-passed background checks bill stalled in the Senate, McConnell says he expects the White House to soon offer next steps.

""We're under discussion about what to do on the gun issue,"" McConnell said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show.

McConnell has made it clear that he won't make any moves without Mr. Trump's commitment to sign the bills into law. But the president has flip-flopped on guns, first suggesting he'd be open to background checks legislation or other measures to try to stem gun violence, only to backtrack after speaking to the National Rifle Association and others in the gun lobby. The Senate leader is trying to avoid a politically uncomfortable situation of Republicans joining Democrats to pass bills, only to have Trump reject them.

Against this backdrop, McConnell outlined what he must see before considering any guns legislation: ""If the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it it'll become law, I'll put it on the floor.""

Senators from both parties have been meeting privately and with the White House on possible areas of agreement. Mr. Trump said he was talking with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., who has a bipartisan background checks bill with Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania that has failed in previous votes.

Toomey, who said he has spoken several times with Mr. Trump over Congress' summer break, said the president has been more consistent in his support for expanding background checks than people give him credit for.

""The president has a real interest in doing something in this area,"" Toomey said. Several Republican senators are also now more interested but, he said, ""it's hard to say how this will turn out.""

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., who is also involved in talks, including with White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, said he is encouraged that the president may be interested in more narrow efforts, including his bipartisan bill with Toomey. It would require federal authorities to alert state officials when people trying to buy firearms are denied by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.

Before lawmakers left town for the six-week summer recess, senators from both parties bemoaned the way the world's most deliberative body has become what Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., calls a pricey lunch club. He too is working on gun legislation.

""I miss the Senate that used to spend the odd-year really legislating and really working on policy,"" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is up for reelection. ""We seem now to be caught up in a constant campaign and that is I think a disservice to the American people.""

Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and chairman of the Senate's health committee, is working on a bipartisan package of bills to lower health care costs. He said there's more happening than the public often sees on the endless loop of political and partisan fighting.

""We always have those two screens going on,"" said Alexander, who is retiring at the end of his term. ""While things could be much better in the United States Senate, there's a lot being done.""

McConnell has taken pride in stopping Democrats' agenda and is incorporating the ""Grim Reaper"" role in his own reelection campaign for 2020. The GOP leader, who suffered a fractured shoulder in a fall in early August, has been recovering at home in Kentucky but is expected to return to open the Senate on Monday.

Small islands and coastal cities in the Asia-Pacific need more funds to assist vulnerable communities and help them decide whether to relocate or stay and defend against rising sea levels and extreme weather, experts have said.

Environmental advocates have pressed for more aggressive action to deal with climate change and global warming.

A three-day UN Climate Change gathering, which ended in the Thai capital of Bangkok on Friday, comes as the widespread damage from Hurricane Dorian on the low-lying Bahamas group of islands in the Atlantic becomes more apparent, highlighting the clear and present danger of climate change.

Images showed some of the Bahamas islands already underwater.

International Youth Climate Movement delegates attending the summit said climate change was an “unprecedented” issue that needed to be addressed with more investment.

“We have a very small window to reverse the actions that are happening today. The world is running out of time.”

Outside the event, a group of environment and social justice activists also gathered to call on governments and private institutions to stop funding fossil fuel extraction to cut carbon emission.

Earlier, Ovais Sarmad, the UN Climate Change deputy executive secretary, described the impacts of climate change around the world as “devastating” and said that “there is urgency” in addressing them.

Last month, Indonesia said it would relocate its capital from the sinking city of Jakarta by 2024 to the island of Borneo.

According to reports, the northern part of the city is sinking 2.5m every 10 years, and will continue to sink by as much as 25cm a year, even if the capital eventually moves.

In July, independent experts proposed building a 20km western dyke and a 12km eastern dyke to protect Jakarta from seawater, while keeping the city of 10 million people from eventually going underwater. According to the Jakarta Post, the project would cost at least $18.7bn.

Bangkok, Manila and Shanghai were also listed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as among the fastest-sinking metropoles in the world.

Sinking cities

A World Bank study predicted that 40 percent of the Thai capital may be submerged by 2030, according to the Bangkok Post.

The news story also cited the country’s 2015 National Reform Council report, which predicted that Bangkok, also known as “Venice of the East”, risks being submerged in less than 15 years if nothing is done.

In Manila, a city of 13 million people, a report published in May showed that parts of the areas just outside of the Philippine capital are already completely underwater, forcing its residents to relocate.

According to IPCC, Manila is subsiding “at a worrying 10cm per year”.

Shanghai, the Chinese coastal city, had already sunk as much as 12.12mm by 2000, according to the Shanghai Institute of Geological Survey.

Since 1921, the city has subsided a total of 2.6 metres, the Asian Correspondent reported.

Further east in the Pacific, Fiji plans to move dozens of coastal villages inland, and the Marshall Islands is building sea walls to protect coastal communities.

“As much as possible, we must try to adapt and mitigate in situ because that’s where people have their homes, land and livelihoods,” Harjeet Singh, global climate change lead at the charity group ActionAid, told Thomson Reuters on Thursday.

“But more places are becoming uninhabitable because of land degradation, rising sea levels or other weather impacts and there is no choice but to relocate.”

20 million people affected

According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, more than 20 million people are uprooted every year by floods, storms, landslides and other extreme winter conditions, with the vast majority of such displacement occurring in the Asia-Pacific region.

Displacement can have devastating impacts on those who have to move, as well as on the communities that receive them, said Victor Bernard, Asia-Pacific programme officer at human rights advocacy the Raoul Wallenberg Institute.

“Countries must ensure relocations are not forced, and that the rights of vulnerable communities are protected,” he said.

Fiji moved its first coastal community inland in 2014, and may have to move dozens more to higher ground as sea levels rise, said Nilesh Prakash, the country’s head of climate change and international cooperation.

Sea-level rise and erosion are set to make most island atolls uninhabitable by 2050, and for the Marshall Islands, home to 75,000 people, moving to higher ground is not an option.

The islanders are already seeing the effects of warming oceans in damaged reefs and fish stocks, said Angeline Heine, the country’s national energy planner.

Scores of Zimbabweans gathered Wednesday to pay their respects to former President Robert Mugabe whose body was repatriated from Singapore.

Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe with an iron fist for close to 40 years, died aged 95, last Friday after months of treatment in a Singapore hospital.

A state funeral will be held on Saturday at the National Sports Stadium in the capital Harare, the government said.

There was singing and dancing as the plane carrying his remains touched down at the Robert Mugabe International Airport. Women dressed in all-white outfits waved handkerchiefs and sang local songs as they danced in tribute.

President Emerson Mnangagwa and his wife also joined the gathered crowd Wednesday at the airport.

Mugabe’s legacy in Zimbabwe is a bittersweet one.

While many revere him as the nation’s founding father who stood up to the British colonials and helped his country gain independence, his latter years in power were marked by brutality and violence towards his own citizens.

Yet many still choose to mourn him and celebrate him as a national hero.

One commentator on Facebook wrote: “He is home to Rest.. The Giant of Zimbabwe.”

Zimbabwean TV host and producer Vimbai Mutihinri told CNN: “The Mugabe I knew was a quick-witted man, with an incredible sense of humor and a totally disarming presence. And he loved patriotic, young people,” the Nigeria-based TV personality said.

Mutihinri, whose father served as a diplomat during Mugabe’s regime, had a chance to meet him several times and as a young child even pinned a rose on his lapel during a visit to their home in Yugoslavia where her father was the ambassador.

Mugabe also threw a special banquet in her honor when she represented Zimbabwe in the reality show Big Brother Africa in 2011.

“My personal experience is distant to the reality of many,” she said. “But this is why it is important for me to share it because while his public roles will face more scrutiny and judgment than ever, it is important to also keep the moments and gestures of love and goodwill that Robert Mugabe extended alive and to celebrate them as a part of his legacy,” she added.

Even in death, Mugabe continues to divide as details of his final resting place are kept under wraps amid suggestions that his family does not want him to be buried at the National Hero’s Acre.

President Mnangagwa declared him a national hero last week and the expectation is that he would join other dead dignitaries there.

Leo Mugabe, his nephew, and the family spokesman said the final decision would ultimately be made by elders in Mugabe’s village.

“We tried to press them for a definite answer, but they said we should not rush them. They are doing what is required by the tradition, you know what happens when a King dies,” the younger Mugabe told CNN.

It doesn’t matter. They’ve travelled to the East for the almost foolish sight of watching Ireland play in a game which they can’t lose and yet must win in order to reassure themselves that that dream - a green rising in Japan - is still alive.

They couldn’t be anywhere more exotic. So why, at around at 4.30pm local time on Thursday, with the sky darkening, does it feel as if they are on their way to the Sportsground or Ravenhill for an early autumn PRO 14 fixture?

The answer is falling from the sky. It rains hard and it rains incessantly and so the Irish slip into old habits. When it rains in any city in Japan, the locals magically and instantly produce perfect rain gear, Clark Kent-ing their way into see through mac’s and water-proof boots.

The Irish, as usual, wing it. They walk stubbornly through the heavy downpour as if it isn’t there and then, in the packed train out to Misakikoen station, declare their outrage.

“Ah Jesus I’m soaked through,” someone informs the crowded carriage.

“I should have brought a coat.”

These are the complaints that have filled many the Irish sporting Sunday and here they are, transported to mid-Japan on an autumn Thursday. It’s true that following Ireland at the World Cup is a magical and privileged experienced. It’s also true that it will bring dozens of Irish fans to that moment where they find themselves huddling under an awning. Of a Laundromat. Singing “It’s a Long Way from Tipperary”.

That’s what you do for the cause. So at half time, Ireland were winning without setting the world on fire. “Couple of lucky bounces,” O’Farrell said wincing.

“Just a bit disturbing the way Kearney and Conway let it bounce,” agreed Paddy Ryan.

“And I think the Russians are quite solid. But… our number ten makes a terrible difference.”

Ryan has been going to Ireland games since the 1960s. He remembers when a win - any win - was a cause for delight. “The expectation is there now. You watch the Kiwis the other night- we aren’t fit to put seventy points on any team.”

Narrator: In 1954, doctors successfully transplanted the first human organ: a kidney taken from a patient's identical twin. Today, around 20,000 kidneys are transplanted every year, and based on estimates from one report, those transplants cost a total of more than $8 billion, and that's just for kidneys. Factor in the 15,000 other organs transplanted each year, and you've got yourself a booming business. Hospitals are in the business of saving lives. Keyword here being ""business,"" and organ transplants, well, they're a pretty great way to add to your bottom line.

Katrina A. Bramstedt: Transplant centers are a good revenue center for hospitals. There are some departments in hospitals that don't make a lot of money. That's absolutely true. I'd be lying if I said, ""Nah."" It's true, and then there's other departments in hospitals including transplant that do tend to, yeah, be profitable for hospitals, absolutely.

Narrator: According to a report published by the consulting firm Milliman, the average billed cost for a heart transplant before insurance is an estimated $1.38 million, and other organs, well, they're not much cheaper. Around half of those costs come from what's called hospital transplant admission. That includes room and board in the hospital along with things like nursing care and medication during your stay. Now, for a heart transplant, which might require something like two weeks of inpatient care, hospital transplant admission adds up to an average of nearly $900,000 a transplant. Some doctors say these prices are so high in part because the hospital's trying to make money.

Dr. Preben Brandenhoff: Here's the dichotomy between hospital interests and our interests as doctors and patient advocates.

Narrator: That's Dr. Preben Brandenhoff. He's a cardiothoracic surgeon who specializes in heart and lung transplants.

Brandenhoff: The hospital, they just want to make money to run the hospital. If you want to be really stone-cold, they're not into taking care of patients.

Narrator: But Dr. Brandenhoff says there's a reason why transplants are so much more expensive than other procedures. Take heart bypass surgery for example. It can cost up to $130,000, but that's just a fraction of the cost of a heart transplant. To understand why, just consider what it takes to transplant an organ. If the organ donor is deceased, there's the expensive medication to keep the organs healthy, then there's the charted flights to get the organs where they need to go.

Brandenhoff: If it is one of these where I go to Hawaii and get the lungs because from the time I have the lungs out and ready to go, it'll be five hours going back to the mainland.

Narrator: And then there's all the trained personnel.

Bramstedt: So you may have 10 surgeons in an operating room working, so it's huge.

Narrator: And each of those surgeons is making a lot of money. According to Salary.com, the average base salary for a heart transplant surgeon is over $600,000 a year compared to, say, a trauma surgeon who makes under $400,000 a year. And finally, there's even more expensive medication to help the body accept the new organ.

Bramstedt: It can cost somebody a couple thousand dollars a month if they don't have insurance.

Narrator: So by the time it's all tallied up, a seven-figure transplant isn't all that surprising, even though the organ might come for free. And when you consider what you get for it, you know, life, it might even be a pretty good deal.",0.1209451659451659,0.532012987012987,0.014,0.879,0.107,0.9928,True,"This article discusses the high cost of organ transplants in the US.

The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the United States is about $5000 (~Texas average cost in year 2000). If a well has developed a leak that allows gas to flow up the outside of the well casing, finding and correcting the leak can push the cost of abandonment beyond $100,000.

Extraordinarily focused and perfectly cordial at almost 80 years of age, it’s she who leads the twists and turns of our discussion, shutting down some topics and expanding on others as she sees fit. After 50 years of telling stories of sparky women and breaking a few moulds in doing so, I’d be disappointed with anything less.

The genre-defining writer – with no less than 27 honorary degrees to her name – delves into something of a history lesson, in which her voracious appetite for learning is clear. Atwood runs through the various waves of immigration from the US to her native Canada, explains how Black Death helped women's lib, and gives assurance after ample research, that with every brutal regime comes those brave enough to defy it – ""the rescuers, spies, couriers – all of those people risking their lives""; in fact, she recalls befriending people involved in the French Resistance in the second World War as a young girl (""But some of them were kids, I don't think they knew that they could get killed""). Later, when we meander on to the lighter topic of Irish authors, she seeks a book recommendation and then quizzes me about Sally Rooney's Normal People, starting with the question: ""And are they normal?"" She's my new choice of dream dinner party guest.

In the 1990s, we all were under the illusion that we were moving away from The Handmaid's Tale. Then it appeared we were moving towards it. But it wasn't until November 9th, 2016, that people woke up and thought this was quite close

But right now, Atwood’s new book, The Testaments, is top of her mind. It’s the follow-up to The Handmaid’s Tale, and not one to follow convention, she’s presented it 34 years after its original release – surely some sort of record, if Harper Lee’s Go Set a Watchman is accepted as a companion piece of To Kill A Mockingbird rather than a sequel. The timing of Atwood’s new novel is spot on, given that the multiple-Emmy-winning television adaptation starring Elisabeth Moss has brought the story of Gilead’s oppressive regime to a new generation. Was that the main prompt to produce a follow-up?

“Why now? Well let’s ask first, why not earlier?” Atwood says, unapologetically deviating from my question. “Earlier, people were saying ‘why not do a sequel?’ and what they meant by that was continuing the story of the central character in The Handmaid’s Tale, and that would not have been possible for me to do. Because what could you add?” she asks (despite it being the premise of the TV series).

“Then history took a different turn. In the 1990s, we all were under the illusion that we were moving away from The Handmaid’s Tale. Then all of a sudden, it appeared that we were moving towards it. But it wasn’t until November 9th, 2016, that people woke up and thought this was really quite close,” she says, referring to Donald Trump’s election win. She had already started writing The Testaments by then, and continued to in earnest as “history changed and I saw a different way of doing the story”.

The original story of The Handmaid’s Tale, about a near-infertile theocracy, in which women are forcibly made to procreate on behalf of their assigned commander and wife, still feels relevant every which way. It’s become a symbol of women’s rights, with the blood red handmaid’s uniform becoming a common sight in protests. When the book was finally translated into Arabic last November, it was viewed as a significant victory for women in the Middle East. Even secondary themes such as isolationism and immigration remain important in the intervening decades; on the day I speak to Atwood, the New York Times’ top story happens to be: “Women Are Fleeing Death at Home. The US Wants to Keep Them Out.” It’s no surprise that Atwood announced the release of The Testaments by saying it was partly inspired by “the world we’ve been living in”, though she won’t be drawn into elaborating. “I don’t wish to analyse, deconstruct, pick apart, or open up my own book for readers, because that is their job,” she says. “Asking me to do it would be me dictating to them how they’re supposed to react and think.”

The very end of The Handmaid’s Tale gave us some conclusion of June’s story – with the epilogue revealing that Offred escaped on the Underground Femaleroad, that Commander Waterford was killed in a purge – and that ultimately, Gilead was a thing of the past. But The Testaments, set 15 years after June was bundled into the van, reveals so much more.

The book is so anticipated I'm brought into the publisher's office to read it under lock and key. Tickets for the London launch sell with a fervour usually reserved for Phoebe Waller-Bridge

Moving away from June as the central character, the sequel is structured as unearthed testimonies from Aunt Lydia, the head warden of the handmaids, and two girls – one inside Gilead, the other in Canada. Like much of Atwood’s work from her debut novel The Edible Woman in 1969 to the Booker Prize-winning The Blind Assassin, the narrative is neat and eloquent enough to be a thing of beauty in itself. Just as well, given it’s a guaranteed cultural phenomenon. The book is so anticipated I’m brought into the publisher’s office to read it under lock and key, and tickets for the launch event in London sold out with a level of fervour usually reserved for Phoebe Waller-Bridge these days. To help satiate demand, the event was beamed across 1,000 cinemas globally.

Like The Handmaid’s Tale, and indeed the TV series, The Testaments follows Atwood’s cardinal rule that “you have to show a real-life precedent for any skulduggery and weird pieces you put in there. There’s no shortage in the 4,000 years of recorded world history.”

A case in point is Aunt Lydia’s ascension from a family court judge to the person in charge of the women of Gilead (she’s also considered a gender traitor by some), which brings up the question of how the people in power end up there. “Are they opportunists, are they true believers? What is the nature of their involvement? Are they doing it in fear? Certainly, if you read the history of Stalinism, that happened a lot,” says Atwood. “You had to back up the party line, or you’d be next. Sometimes you’d be next anyway.”

Yet Aunt Lydia isn’t only playing ball to keep herself alive. “She’s manipulating herself into a position of power and collecting all the dirt on everyone, which is exactly what J Edgar Hoover did in the United States. He was head of the FBI. Any intelligence service, that’s what they do. And if they’re particularly unscrupulous they use secrets to manipulate the people who ostensibly have the power.”

I was very happy to be able to visit Newgrange – it's a remarkable place, particularly since they built it without horses or wheels

With the TV series taking on a life of its own – Atwood sold the rights to MGM three decades ago and now consults in the MGM/Hulu partnership – there’s the question of how The Testaments will work with the show.

“We didn’t want a novelisation of the TV series; that would have been bad,” Atwood says. “But because it takes place 15 or 16 years into the future there’s no overlap of that kind. I did say ‘this person has to be on this side of the border’ and ‘hands off that baby. No baby killing’.”

Is the intention to pick up where the series will finish? “We haven’t had that conversation yet but I’ve left them a lot of wiggle room,” she says. “The entire backstory of what happens to the characters in The Handmaid’s Tale and in the series is basically up to them. Except for Aunt Lydia.”

Yet with a fourth series in the works, and The Testaments its end goal, it makes me wonder how and when the series will reach it, especially given the reception has waned across the series run. According to that imperfect barometer of sentiment – Rotten Tomatoes – the first series earned an audience score of 91 per cent, but the third, 53 per cent. Stating it bluntly, the complaints seem to be that June’s story is stretched out with weaker plots, repeated devices, and unlikely character decisions. “You know, that’s not my business,” Atwood says. “I think everybody in the show is extremely dedicated to it. And you cannot fault the acting.”

Atwood can’t yet say whether The Testaments will be adapted for television, or indeed cinema, but if it is, it won’t be her penning the story. “I did screenwriting in the 1970s and 1980s. It’s lots of fun if you like the people and the project, and total hell if you don’t,” she says. “Whereas writing a novel is for megalomaniacs and control freaks, because you control everything – at least until you get it into the hands of your editors. At my age, I’m not going to go through the oddly summer camp experience of screenwriting with a group of people.”

For the next while, she’s preparing a book of poetry “which I think is a good thing to be doing just before you start out on a major book tour that will probably kill you,” she jokes.

The tour visits Dublin in November, “and you’ll be sick of me, because I’m going back to Borris Literary Festival next year too,” she says. “It was magic when I visited before, it’s really quite wonderful. It’s small enough that it’s not overwhelming. And I was very happy to be able to visit Newgrange – it’s a remarkable place, particularly since they built it without horses or wheels.”

For someone who wrote The Handmaid’s Tale in the dystopian year of 1984 and in west Berlin while the Wall was intact, it seems apt that she’ll be present at another pertinent time in history: she’ll complete the UK leg of her book tour on October 31st, Brexit D-Day.

“I feel sad about Brexit. I feel it’s something they stumbled into without really knowing what they were doing,” she says. “I think they just kind of walked into it, and of course Ireland risks being plunged into north-south warfare if they establish a border.”

I guess you have to avoid getting into more of a mess than you're already in. Madeleine Albright has a very good book called Fascism: A Warning, and she lays out all the signs

Clearly educated in politics, power and history, I wonder if she can shed any light on how we, as a generation, can get out of this mess. “You think I know?” she laughs. “I guess you have to avoid getting into more of a mess than you’re already in. Madeleine Albright has a very good book called Fascism: A Warning, and she lays out all the signs. They include the destruction of a free and independent press, the conflation of an independent judiciary with the ruling of executive powers, and they always include rolling back of the rights of women. That’s just a bit of the playlist. She runs over quite a few of these kinds of governments. We think of Italy, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Russia, but there’s a lot that has happened in places since – like Chile and Cambodia and Rwanda. So these things have been happening in the 20th and 21st century, and nobody’s exempt.”

That’s a stark warning given the increase in right-wing aggression in Ireland, until recently thought to be unaffected by the rising nationalism elsewhere. “Oh no, you should never think it’s not possible,” she says, after enquiring about these current affairs. “Nowhere gets a seal of approval from the universe that says your society will never do that.”

As our time comes to an end, I ask if she intends to dig out more stories from within Gilead, or whether The Testaments was intended as the final instalment.

“I would never ever answer such a question. People who say ‘no’ end up doing it, and then they have to say why they changed their mind. And the people who say ‘yes’ and don’t do it then have to answer questions about why they didn’t do it.

“I think poor old George RR Martin is being driven crazy by people asking what he’s doing on Game of Thrones. Apparently he’s still writing away at it. I learned a long time ago to never say what I will or will not do.”

The massive funding rounds going to startups aren't just squeezing out early-stage investors. They're forcing companies to grow at all costs, whether or not the founders are ready for it.

Menlo Ventures has created a fund dedicated solely to these founders called an ""inflection fund."" Instead of trying to beat mega-funds to the seed funding punch, Menlo is banking on its track record and expertise to offer founders a guiding light around a Series B or Series C stage. And in August, the firm brought on former growth equity investor Jean-Paul Sanday to lead the charge.

""Our average check at the fund I worked on at Summit was $30 [million], $35 [million], or $40 million. Now it's $130 million,"" Sanday told Business Insider. ""The businesses are just different businesses, but they still need help no sooner or no later than before.""

Having been on both the investing and startup side, Sanday is a prime candidate to help Menlo Ventures' portfolio companies navigate what he calls the ""rocky"" inflection point in growth. According to Sanday, a startup has hit the inflection point once the recruiting team starts receiving resumes unsolicited, customer growth is outpacing what would be expected based on the team's marketing budget, and customer experience plummets.

In the past, this stage was reserved for a company that had been around for several years, Sanday explained. But with the sudden influx of funding, immature founders are finding themselves with ballooning costs, teams, and issues without understanding how to actually address any of them.

""The businesses can grow up really fast or get a lot of traction in the headline numbers really quickly,"" Sanday said. ""They have a lot of employees, a lot of revenue, but their maturity is no different, right? Most of the entrepreneurial journey is knowing how to do that.""

An insider's growth mindset

Sanday came to Silicon Valley like many other investors-to-be: he enrolled at Stanford, and eventually started a mobile ads company with a classmate while he was finishing business school.

""We decided not to raise money for it because it was a mobile ads network and, at the time, that was like the Wild West and there's all kinds of messy in that industry,"" Sanday said.

Still intrigued by the burgeoning mobile industry, Sanday moved over to a mobile gaming startup to run the young company's growth operation. He said during his tenure, the company went from being ""five people working out of a garage"" to over 250 employees in ""an actual office."" Although he's written plenty of hefty investment checks during two runs at private equity firm Summit Partners, Sanday says his most valuable experience was experiencing that inflection point first hand.

""At this stage there's so much more uncertainty,"" Sanday said. ""You can have a differentiating perspective, a different angle, certainly in the way you can help them,but I also think there's room for you to lean in more.""

Sanday will be doling out checks ranging from $20 million to $40 million, with room for follow on investments, through the inflection fund. Having just returned from paternity leave, he has not personally invested just yet.

""My bones speak to me and sometimes there are just things that I can just know about or empathize with just simply as a partner to the founder,"" Sanday said. ""It's hard when you're writing a $100 million checks to empathize like that. Some of the entrepreneurs haven't done this before, so they don't know what those companies look like.""",0.1177861952861952,0.4268710918710919,0.021,0.893,0.086,0.994,True,"The article discusses Menlo Ventures' new ""inflection stage"" fund, which is designed to help young startups that are dealing with late-stage problems.

Scandal

The five retail banks in the Republic set out in late 2017 to establish the Irish Banking Culture Board (IBCB) in the wake of the tracker-mortgage scandal, as they faced the prospect of politicians and regulators taking action to address culture issues in the banks. The 14-member board was officially set up in April. It comprises five senior bankers and seven non-banking members, including consumer advocates, business representatives and academics.

“I’m sufficiently cynical myself about the rationale as to why it came into existence,” he said. “But here we are. The banks had to create something and we’re it. I’ve some considerable hope.”

Mr Justice Hedigan said he got involved personally when he learned over the summer that banks were contesting the Financial Services Ombudsman attempts to investigate tracker-case complaints, claiming they fell outside a legal six-year time limit. The IBCB’s five member banks committed in late August to waive this time limit.

The results of an industry-wide survey, carried out by the board before its April establishment, underscored the challenge ahead. It found that over a third of staff in the sector wanted to raise a concern over the previous 12 months, mainly relating to their company not acting in the best interests of customers.

However, more than two in five respondents of these failed to speak up, fearing that it would either be held against them or that nothing would come of it.

Awareness

Acting IBCB chief executive Marion Kelly said the board had been focusing on three areas to date:

– how banks can make it easier for staff to speak up and challenge authority;

– how services for bereaved customers can be improved, and;

– financial awareness and education for the general public.

The board, which will shortly start a search for a permanent CEO, will later this week begin looking at how banks work with vulnerable customers.

Committee member Michael McGrath TD, Fianna Fáil’s spokesman on finance, asked the IBCB to look also at how banks deal with customers involved in a relationship breakdown. He highlighted cases where one party to a breakdown may wish to take on the entire mortgage for the family home but that banks insist that they need to take out a fresh mortgage.

“Very often it’s the family home, with children involved, which can be very difficult,” he said.

Committee chairman, John McGuinness TD, also of Fianna Fáil, said the IBCB faces an uphill struggle trying to get banks to change their ways.

You could say things are getting a little more concrete on the International Space Station.

Astronauts on the station often share beautiful images and time lapses they capture from their unique vantage point 220 miles above the Earth. But they’re also working on hundreds of experiments on the floating laboratory every day.

One recent experiment included mixing an aqueous solution with tricalcium silicate for the first time – a scientific way of saying concrete. The basic ingredients for concrete include sand, gravel and rocks mixed with a cement powder and water-based paste. It sounds as easy as whipping up cake mix, but the actual process is much more difficult.

And the lack of gravity changes everything.

Astronauts participated in the Microgravity Investigation of Cement Solidification project to understand how the chemistry of concrete is changed by zero gravity, down to the microscopic structures inside it.

“How will it harden? What will be the microstructure?” said Aleksandra Radlinska, principal investigator of the experiment at Pennsylvania State University. “Those are the questions we’re trying to answer.”

The paper published this week in the journal Frontiers in Materials.

A variety of mixtures were made where the cement powder, additives, water and time allowance varied. The researchers studied how the cement powder dissolved in the water because this is when those molecular structures shift to create interlocking crystals.

These images compare cement pastes mixed in space (above) and on Earth (below). The sample from space shows more open spaces in the material. Penn State Materials Characterization Lab

The space station mixtures were compared to samples mixed on Earth. The cement paste in space ended up being more porous, which is intriguing because more open spaces in the concrete would affect its strength.

“Increased porosity has direct bearing on the strength of the material, but we have yet to measure the strength of the space-formed material,” said Radlinska. “Even though concrete has been used for so long on Earth, we still don’t necessarily understand all the aspects of the hydration process. Now we know there are some differences between Earth- and space-based systems and we can examine those differences to see which ones are beneficial and which ones are detrimental to using this material in space.”

Radlinska also noted that the samples were mixed in sealed pouches, which begs the question of what might happen had they been mixed in an open environment in space.

Understanding how concrete works in space has direct bearing on future plans regarding the moon and Mars, according to NASA. Building safe habitats on either of these surfaces may rely on concrete because it could protect humans from meteorites and harmful radiation.

Materials already available on Mars or the moon could also be used to make the concrete. Moon dust, known as regolith, could be an ingredient in space-based concrete. Having materials already on hand would reduce the cost of transporting materials.

There’s currently an experiment on the space station looking at cement samples that include simulated lunar particles.

“On missions to the Moon and Mars, humans and equipment will need to be protected from extreme temperatures and radiation, and the only way to do that is by building infrastructures on these extraterrestrial environments,” Radlinska said.

“One idea is building with a concrete-like material in space. Concrete is very sturdy and provides better protection than many materials.

“We confirmed the hypothesis that this can be done. Now we can take next steps to find binders that are specific for space and for variable levels of gravity, from (zero gravity to Mars gravity) and in between.”

The insight was that a flight to ""only"" 100 km would reach the officially-defined edge of space, and even though this is much easier a challenge than an orbital flight, such a suborbital flight would be of excitement to the public, and the pilot would be officially qualified as an astronaut. A small group of rocket enthusiasts, computer hobbyists, and science-fiction writers gathered together to do a preliminary design, with the ultimate goal of moving on to building a prototype, with (then) physics student David Burkhead leading the technical effort. The vehicle design was discussed in many venues, and presentations on the design progress were given in several conferences, such as the 1995NSS International Space Development Conference, where it attracted considerable popular attention.

Due to the outflow of the nearby Hurricane Gustav, Hanna weakened back into a tropical storm the next day as it began to drift northwestwards towards the Southeastern United States. The storm struck Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, before moving up the Eastern Seaboard to become an extratropical cyclone as it moved by New England into Atlantic Canada early on September 7.

Further weakening occurred several hours after re-emerging into the Atlantic, becoming downgraded to a category 2 hurricane. However, it re-strengthened into a category 4 hurricane before making landfall just slightly north of Charleston, on Isle of Palms on September 21 with 140 mph sustained winds (gusts to more than 160 mph).

British Airways was forced to cancel virtually all flights for Monday and Tuesday after its pilots went on strike for the first time in the airline’s history.

The strike was called by the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA) amid a heated dispute over pay with the airline that shows no sign of abating. BALPA is planning another strike for September 27 and told CNN Business on Monday that further strike dates may be announced.

Nearly 200,000 passengers were due to travel on September 9 and 10, a British Airways (BA) spokespersonsaid.

Why the strike?

Pilots are unhappy with BA’s offer of an 11.5% salary increase over three years. They want a greater share of the airline’s burgeoning profits. BA posted operating profit of nearly £2 billion ($2.5 billion)for 2018, an 11.6% increase over the previous year.

“We are seeking to share in a tiny fraction of that huge profit,” a BALPA spokesperson told CNN Business.

In harder times, pilots had made “significant sacrifices” to keep BA afloat, such as giving up annual leave and accepting pay cuts, the spokesperson said.“Fundamentally BA pilots have lost trust and confidence in their management.”

BALPA general secretary Brian Strutton told the BBC on Monday that the profit sharing arrangement the union had proposed would entail staff receiving up to 7% of base pay in good times and zero when times were tough. It would not involve an increase in base pay.

In emailed responses to CNN Business, BALPA said that the dispute could be settled for an additional £5 million, but gave no detail on how it had arrived at that figure.

BA said other labor unions, representing nearly 90% of all BA staff, including engineers, cabin crew and ground staff, had accepted the pay increase of 11.5%.

“The average salary for a BA Captain is £167,000 [$206,000] plus flying allowances. The offer of 11.5% would take the average salary to £202,000,” a BA spokesperson said. A first officer earns £90,000 on average, the spokesperson said.

All major US airlines have profit sharing programs, but they vary in the degree to which they are successful in improving labor relations, said Adrian Yanoshik, a senior analyst at Berenberg.Done well, a BA program could be viewed positively by investors, he added.

What it means for passengers

Passengers due to fly on September 9 and 10 are highly unlikely to be able to travel as planned. The airline advised them not to go to the airport.

BA said it would offer “as many customers as possible” — including those connecting from flights with other airlines — the option to rebook on other airlines, or have their flights refunded.

Knock-on effects were expected to cause some disruption to flights later this week, a spokesperson said.

With another strike planned for September 27, BA said it would contact passengers traveling on that date if their flights were likely to be impacted.

Passengers should keep checking the BA website for updates.

What it means for BA

The cost of the strike would be around £40 million($49 million) per day, according to BALPA. The three strike days already scheduledwould cost in the region of £120 million ($148 million).

The airline said it was forced to cancel so many flights because “with no detail from BALPA on which pilots would strike, we had no way of predicting how many would come to work or which aircraft they are qualified to fly.”

Members of the pilots union voted 93% in favor of a strike in July. BALPA said last week that it would be willing to call it off if British Airways returned to the negotiating table.

BA is part of the International Consolidated Airlines Group (ICAGY) (IAG), alongside airlines such as Iberia and Aer Lingus. IAG’s stock has fallen more than 31% this year, partly in expectation that the dispute with pilots would culminate in a strike, Berenberg’s Yanoshik said.

An extended period of strikes would have a “material negative” impact on IAG’s bottom line, he added.

The strike action at BA will also add to the airline’s recent public relations woes. In July, the UK Information Commissionersaid it would fine BA £183 million ($226 million) under data protection rules for an earlier theft of customer data. Then in August, an IT failure disrupted more than 400 flights leaving the United Kingdom.",0.0571183142904454,0.4503353204172875,0.099,0.814,0.088,0.3071,True,"This article appears to be factual, describing a real event involving a strike by British Airways pilots.

Antonio Brown declined to sign a $2 million-plus agreement with Britney Taylor to settle a sexual assault allegation made by the wide receiver's former trainer, sources told ESPN's Jeff Darlington.

Brown had a deadline last Sunday night to sign the settlement agreement before Taylor's attorneys sought to file their civil lawsuit against him. After Brown didn't sign off on the settlement, the suit was filed Tuesday.

Settlement discussions began as early as April and included two mediations, one of which occurred in May, sources familiar with the talks told Darlington.

Brown's decision not to sign the settlement came around the same time that he agreed to a deal with the New England Patriots, which his agent revealed Sept. 7 and was formalized Monday.

In the lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, Taylor accuses Brown of sexually assaulting her on three occasions in 2017 and 2018.

The NFL is set to meet with Taylor on Monday as part of its investigation into the matter, a source confirmed to ESPN.

A source told ESPN's Josina Anderson that Taylor has given information to the league in advance of the meeting. The source said they were not told that Brown or any of his representatives would be at that meeting and are not expecting them to be.

ESPN had previously reported that the NFL and Taylor were expected to meet in the upcoming week. NFL Network first reported Sunday that the meeting would take place on Monday.

The league is waiting until it speaks with Taylor to determine where the investigation goes next, a source told ESPN's Dan Graziano.

Brown made his season debut with the Patriots in Miami Sunday. Sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Friday that Brown was not placed on the commissioner's exempt list because there is no criminal investigation into the wide receiver.

Brown's lawyer, Darren Heitner, said in a statement Tuesday that his client and Taylor were involved in a ""consensual personal relationship.""",0.1049840510366825,0.3506778309409888,0.054,0.915,0.031,-0.836,True,"The article reports on the NFL's meeting with Britney Taylor regarding sexual assault allegations against Patriots wide receiver Antonio Brown.

Expectations rose in Brussels on Friday night that the UK will submit its long-awaited formal proposals on the backstop to the EU at the end of the Tory Party conference next week.

Taoiseach Leo Varadkar renewed his calls for Britain to table written proposals next week, but warned that he was “not particularly optimistic” that this would happen.

“Based on what’s happened in the last month or two I’m not particularly optimistic,” he said in Los Angeles on Friday night. “But there is still time, albeit time running short. And if we’re going to be in position to agree something at the European Council on the 17th and 18th of October we’re really going to need to work that up in the week or two before it.”

Mr Varadkar said it would be “really helpful”to get proposals in writing in the first week of October. “Ones that provide a workable and legally-binding solution to the problem. And that is giving us the assurance that there will be no hard Border between North and South. That the all-island economy will continue to operate, the North side co-operation can continue as envisaged under the Good Friday agreement.”

Brussels again warned on Friday that time was running out for a deal. EU sources here say they do not believe leaders will be willing to enter detailed discussions on text at the summit.

Meetings have been continuing in Brussels at technical level between the two sides, and on Friday Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay met the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier.

Separately, Tánaiste Simon Coveney also met Mr Barnier, and both men complained that they have yet to see ""legally operable"" proposals from the UK. Mr Coveney spoke of ""wide gaps"" remaining.

Political will

Mr Barclay said after the talks that the UK remained “committed to securing a deal”.

“The prime minister has made clear he wants a deal, but there has to be political will on both sides, and that’s what we’re exploring.”

He also insisted the commission was open to renegotiating the backstop.

“President [Jean-Claude] Juncker made clear that he believes a deal can be done, so does the prime minister. President Juncker also said he’s not wedded to the backstop; we’re clear that for a deal to happen the backstop has to go.”

The backstop is an insurance policy guaranteeing no hard Border on the island of Ireland.

London also sees elements of the guarantees Brussels is seeking in any alternative to the backstop as unreasonable.

It is prepared to defend the Belfast Agreement, and the integrity of the single market. However, it is understood to believe the requirement to ensure that Brexit should not affect the all-Ireland economy stretches the reasonable interpretation of the Belfast Agreement.

A requirement that the result of a Brexit outcome on the Ireland economy would be the same as a no-Brexit outcome is an impossible test, it is argued.

They are understood to believe that British prime minister Boris Johnson’s willingness to be flexible on SPS (food and animal health rules) needs to be reciprocated by the EU’s negotiators.

Customs controls

Talks on UK “non-papers” on food and animal health rules and east-west trade have reportedly been difficult, particularly on the need for customs controls on the Irish Sea even if there is regulatory alignment between North and South.

“What the UK will not accept,” says one EU official, “is that regulatory alignment without membership of a customs union is simply not enough. While customs union membership without regulatory alignment is also not enough.”

British sources also deny that it wants to create a deregulated low-standard economy.

Ireland’s focus in the Brexit talks is avoiding a no-deal, but Dublin would be amenable to granting a further extension to the UK if no agreement can be reached, Mr Coveney told journalists after his meeting with Mr Barnier.

“From an Irish perspective we of course think an extension is preferable to a no deal, but I think there would need to be good reason behind that ask for an extension.”",0.0701863354037267,0.3510351966873705,0.052,0.854,0.094,0.9854,True,"This article appears to be a genuine news article, as it provides specific details and quotes from relevant individuals, such as Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay.

The document was prepared in the final months of 1994 and early 1995 before being presented to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and the leaders of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 30 January 1995. Although Tuđman was displeased with the proposal, the RSK authorities—influenced by Serbian President Slobodan Milošević—refused to receive the document, let alone discuss it.

Greece may also block Macedonia\'s accession to the European Union over the naming dispute. Former United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has asked Macedonia and Greece to find an ""acceptable solution"" to the dispute, so that Macedonia will be free to join NATO. In 2014, prior to its 65th anniversary since its creation, NATO announced that it would not be offering any new countries membership into the organization that year. Some analysts, such as Jorge Benitez of the Atlantic Council think tank, argued that this reluctance was partly due to the new security climate after Russia\'s annexation of Crimea.']"

The storm gradually intensified, becoming a tropical storm the following day and then hurricane on June 29. As the storm neared landfall, an eye developed and Boris reached its peak intensity with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Shortly after, the hurricane made landfall along the south coast of Mexico, between Lazaro Cardenas and Acapulco, at this intensity. Boris quickly weakened following its landfall, becoming a tropical depression roughly 18 hours later.

Andrew caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana, but the greatest impact was felt in South Florida, with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph (270 km/h). Passing directly through the city of Homestead in Dade County (now known as Miami-Dade County), it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations.

Boris Johnson keeps saying he really, really doesn’t want an election. In reality, he wants nothing more. It’s the only way out of the Brexit mess he finds himself in.

The British Prime Minister has been cornered by his own political missteps and parliamentary defeats. He is still insisting he will take the UK out of the European Union on October 31 – with or without a deal. But his negotiations with the EU appear more or less dead in the water and Parliament passed a bill this week that requires him to ask the EU for an extension if no agreement is reached.

Johnson said he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than ask for a delay but also refused to say he’d resign if it got to that point. He wrote to Conservative MPs to say that asking the EU for a Brexit extension “is something I will never do,” reported the Daily Telegraph, which saw a copy of the letter he sent on Friday night.

But barring the possibility of knowingly breaking the law, an election is the only way he can keep his word.

The election option

It looks like a good idea. Johnson is ahead in the polls and if he could secure a larger majority, his problems would – at least partially – disappear.

The problem: It’s not up to Boris Johnson to decide when Brits go to the polls.

Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act of 2011, the law that sets the rules on how election is called, at least two-thirds of lawmakers need to support a call for an early vote.

Johnson lost his first bid to hold an election on Wednesday, but decided to schedule another vote on the issue in the House of Commons on Monday. Opposition parties came out with an unusually united front on Friday, saying they would not support it.

Johnson could try to bypass the super-majority hurdle by putting down a new piece of legislation that would effectively override the current election law. A one-line bill would suffice, saying something along the lines of “notwithstanding the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, the election will be held on day X.”

“The advantage there is that you would only need a simple majority… the disadvantage is that he doesn’t have a majority anymore, so it’s unlikely that that would pass either,” says Ian Dunt, a British political commentator who edits the politics.co.uk wesbite.

Johnson’s minority problem

The Prime Minister lost his working parliamentary majority earlier this week when a Conservative MP dramatically defected at the start of his first speech after the summer recess. Johnson then further undermined his position by firing 21 rebel Conservatives who voted against the government, in support of the bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit.

Another issue with a one-line bill is that just like any legislation in Parliament, it would be open to amendment. Johnson would risk the opposition teaming up with Conservative rebels to change the law in a way that could hurt him even more – altering the election date, or extending the vote to 16- and 17-year-olds, a measure mooted for years but that is thought to benefit progressive parties.

The no-confidence option

A nuclear option would be to call a no-confidence vote in his own government.

“It would get him to where he possibly wants, there would be a general election, unless within 14 days his or another government can secure a confidence vote,” said Ruth Fox, the director of the Hansard Society, a leading constitutional research organization.

However, she points out the absurdity of that situation: “It would be extraordinary for a government to lay a motion of no confidence in itself and encourage [its] party to vote for that.”

Aside of being potentially embarrassing and completely unprecedented, the move could also run afoul of the UK’s unwritten constitution.

The Fixed-term Parliaments Act doesn’t explicitly forbid Johnson from calling his own no confidence vote. But when that law was being passed in 2011, the then Conservative minister for constitutional reform Mark Harper said such a move would be “absolutely unconstitutional” and warned that “public would not respond well to a government behaving in that way.”

That view was later endorsed by Parliament’s Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee. But these are unprecedented times, and that which once seemed unthinkable is now very much possible.

Corbyn’s options are not much better

While Boris Johnson has spent the summer insisting he doesn’t want an election only to call for one on the first day after Parliament came back, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has done the exact opposite.

Corbyn has been calling for an early election for months. Presented with an opportunity to hold one, he refused. Why? Because he, just like the Prime Minister, knows all too well that an election is Johnson’s only way out.

Corbyn, while currently running behind Johnson in opinion polls, has some advantages. “He’s much better during elections than he is the rest of the time, he sort of seems to come alive during an election … last time that saw some improvement for him,” Dunt says.

The Labour leader wants to push the election to a later date, because he is hoping that the current Brexit chaos will split the already torn apart Conservative Party further, making it more vulnerable to attacks from the more radical Brexit Party.

“He needs to do that while not upsetting people too much… it’s a difficult thing to go on TV and say, you know, you want an election, but not yet,” Dunt says.

He is in luck: Many other opposition lawmakers want to push any election until after the current Brexit deadline of October 31 to eliminate the risk of the UK crashing out without a deal.

Corbyn’s other option is to try to put together his own administration – the kind of “unity government” countries form when they are fighting wars or find themselves in other kinds of national crises.

Unfortunately for him, that option appears to be ruled out by the fact that quite few of the other opposition parties are not big fans of his brand of left-wing, anti-establishment politics.

Corbyn has so far refused to give way to someone who would be acceptable to the Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party and the roughly two dozen former Conservatives who have left or have been kicked out of the party by Johnson. But he may not have a choice.

“There would be a motion for Jeremy Corbyn to be the caretaker Prime Minister, and that would fail,” Dunt said. “And once that fails, then he would have to think ‘well, okay, so who’s it going to be.’”

That could pave the way to another senior parliamentarian taking the reins for a time-limited government with the single aim of securing an extension to the Brexit process.

And what then?

The Whigs and Tories were at odds over whether Melbourne's defeat required his resignation, with Queen Victoria being advised that Lord Brougham advising her that calling an election would be without precedent, and that it should only be dissolved to strengthen the governments hands, whereas dissolution facing the Whigs in 1841 was expected to result in their defeat.

Thirty-seven of the protesters were detained, reports CBS San Francisco.

According to protesters with Direct Action Anywhere, Monday's actions were necessary because the grocery chain sells goods from suppliers that allegedly abuse their animals and keep them in ""cruel conditions."" The group claimed they demonstrated after ""repeated attempts to start a dialogue with Amazon"" resulted in no action.

Amazon, which Bezos founded, acquired Whole Foods in 2017.

""We've tried everything to help animals being criminally abused at these factory farms that supply to Amazon,"" activist Priya Sawhney said in a statement. ""The authorities continually ignore the misconduct, then throw us in jail when we try to help dying animals ourselves. And through it all, Amazon stands by its supplier, refusing to even have a conversation with us.""

One person tweeted photos and videos of the protest, including a video of someone scaling the Whole Foods sign.

Police officers used bolt cutters to remove chains from some demonstrators and began making arrests. The organization told CBS News that all have since been released.

A smaller rally simultaneously took place at an Amazon office in San Francisco. Several activists, including former ""Baywatch"" actress Alexandra Paul, were arrested for handcuffing themselves together inside the office. The purpose, the group said, was to ""further emphasize the gravity of this issue and to pressure a response from Amazon.""

Whole Foods released a statement to CBS San Francisco noting its use of ""third-party certifiers like Global Animal Partnership,"" a nonprofit that rates animal welfare for farmed products.

Permanent TSBis laying the groundwork for its first sale of bonds where investors could suffer losses if the bank runs into trouble in the future, even after Bank of Ireland surprised the market by pulling a debt sale last week as negative Brexit headlines rattled financial markets. Joe Brennan has the details.

In his column, Chris Johns returns to the theme of Brexit and describes Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings as a bad tribute act to Theresa May given their handling last week of the political mess around the UK's exit from the European Union.

Bank of Ireland has had its name linked with a complex tax-evasion scandal that has rocked corporate Germany in recent years. The Irish lender is one of a number of banks and financial services company named by witnesses in the case. Joe Brennan reports.

EY sees Irish economic growth falling back to 3.7 per cent in 2019 and being slashed to 1.3 per cent next year in the event of a no-deal Brexit, before rebounding to 2.1 per cent in 2021. There's also grim news for the North in a no-deal scenario. Joe Brennan has the details.

On Thursday, the frontrunners in the Democratic presidential primary race came together for their sixth debate.

While discussions about climate change have largely been absent from debate stages in past elections, the seven candidates spent 13 minutes expounding on their climate platforms on Thursday.

Much of the conversation centered on what to do about the parts of the US where residents face the biggest climate-related risks.

Entrepreneur Andrew Yang re-affirmed his promise to help Americans living in places vulnerable to the effects of climate change to relocate. Sen. Bernie Sanders said he thinks moving people to new homes is a poor approach to the climate problem. Sen. Amy Klobuchar split the difference, suggesting moving only individual homes, not whole cities. And former vice president Joe Biden said the US should build stronger infrastructure, rather than relocate anyone.

The father of an Irish doctor who perished when an Air France transatlantic flight from Brazil crashed has said that the family will appeal a decision by French judges to drop charges against the airline and Airbus.

John Butler, father of Aisling Butler, one of three Irish women who were killed in the crash, told RTÉ radio’s News at One that he will be joining with other families in appealing the judgement.

On Thursday French judges dropped charges against Air France and Airbus over the crash in 2009 that killed all 228 people onboard, blaming the pilots for losing control of the plane.

In their conclusions, seen by Reuters, the judges said the pilots of the Airbus A330 had failed to process all the warnings and instrument readings provided by the aircraft.

The plane crashed en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris after entering an aerodynamic stall and falling from an altitude of 38,000 feet during a storm, its engines running but its wings losing lift.

Disappointed but not surprised

Aisling Butler, of Roscrea, Co Tipperary, Jane Deasy from Dublin and Eithne Walls, originally from Belfast, were among the dead.

“The direct cause of the accident is the crew’s loss of control of the aircraft’s trajectory,” the judges determined.

A lawyer representing the families of victims said an appeal against the judges’ decision would be lodged immediately.

Mr Butler said that as a family they were very disappointed, but not really surprised at the decision. “We are very, very disappointed, it is 10 years hence, we never got the body of Aisling back and it’s one of those things that we’re living with every day.”

He added that he doesn’t understand the logic of the magistrates’ decision. “Everyone is responsible for what they do. Air France is the national airline of France and everyone was a paying passenger. Airbus are the manufacturer and supplier of the aircraft involved, so they are responsible.

“Yes, we will join an appeal by relatives, ‘tis too easy to lie back and do nothing. This organisation was put together to really remind Air France, remind Airbus and certainly remind Air France as to the way they train their pilots so that this never happens again.”

Open Extended Reactions

Florida Gators quarterback Feleipe Franks will have surgery next Monday on a broken right ankle and will miss the rest of the season, coach Dan Mullen said.

Franks, who dislocated and broke the ankle during Saturday night's 29-21 win on the road at Kentucky, will be out for about six months, Mullen said Monday.

""Obviously, it's a tragic deal,"" Mullen said.

Franks, who started 23 games entering Saturday, suffered the injury during the third quarter with his team trailing by 11 points. The ankle was immediately placed in an inflatable cast and he was carted off the field, surrounded by his teammates.

""I went out there and I was with him, you know, told him we all love him, we're there for him, and he'll be all right,"" Mullen said. ""I think the team [gathering around Franks] shows what he means to the team, and what the team thinks of him, you know as the leader of the team, and the type of guy he is, how hard he works, to go do that. And shows a lot about him and what the team thinks.

""It really, to me, shows the respect that they have for his leadership and the love that they have for him.""

Franks was replaced by junior Kyle Trask, who completed his first four passes and ended the drive by pitching the ball to Lamical Perine, who ran 8 yards for a touchdown. Trask then ran in the go-ahead touchdown with 4:11 left in the game.

""Kyle was waiting for his moment,"" Mullen told ESPN. ""The team believes in him and we believe he's a starter, just like Feleipe is. ... There was never a doubt he could do the job.""

Happy Sunday. A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here.

The US Federal Reserve looks set to follow the European Central Bank, and cut rates next week by perhaps a quarter of a percentage point. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has made clear that he doesn’t think a US recession is likely, but he has acknowledged that economic headwinds are intensifying.

“There are all these risks, and we’re monitoring them very carefully and we’re conducting policy in a way that will address them,” he said earlier this month.

The comments helped bolster investor expectations that a rate cut will be announced following the central bank’s meeting on September 17 and 18. The Fed slashed interest rates for the first time in a decade in July as the cost of the US-China trade war mounted.

“The domestically focused, consumer-orientated parts of the economy are holding up, but with inflation looking non-threatening the Federal Reserve has scope to offer support to the economy,” wrote analysts at ING, a Dutch bank.

The Trump factor: US President Donald Trump has been using his Twitter feed to keep the pressure on the central bank. “The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt,” he tweeted last week.

Lest Trump’s own nominee to lead the Fed not get the message, the president used the ECB’s decision last week to push interest rates further into negative territory to drive his point home.

“They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports…. And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!” he tweeted.

Over to you, Mr. Powell.

US stock records on tap?

Fed action could lead the S&P 500 and Dow to new all-time highs. Last week was stellar for stocks, with concessions by the United States and China raising hopes that trade negotiations could yield a breakthrough if they resume next month as expected.

China agreed last week to exempt shrimp, cancer drugs, pesticides and more than a dozen other products from tariffs. US President Donald Trump responded by delaying a planned tariff increase from October 1 until October 15 in what he called “a gesture of good will.” Then, on Friday, Beijing cleared the way for more purchases of US soybeans and pork.

The Dow added 1.6% last week for its third consecutive weekly gain. The S&P 500 rose nearly 1% and Nasdaq rose 0.5% last week, matching the Dow’s winning streak.

Apple’s next big test

The iPhone 11 and its more expensive Pro brothers go on sale in a large handful of countries Friday.

Apple (AAPL) could use a sales win: iPhone sales have fallen in three of the past four quarters, and with China’s economy in a prolonged slump, there’s little chance of a turnaround in the near future.

That’s why Apple is banking on its $5-a-month Apple TV+ and Arcade subscription services to help boost revenue.

But investors will still pay close attention to reports about how well Apple’s iPhone 11 sales performed during its opening weekend. The lower-than-expected $699 price could give those sales a boost.

Saudi oil capacity

Oil traders are on alert after coordinated strikes knocked out 5.7 million barrels a day of Saudi Arabia’s crude oil and gas production, about half the country’s total output.

Two Saudi Aramco sites including the world’s biggest petroleum processing facility were struck. State-owned Aramco “hopes to have that capacity restored within days,” a source told CNN Business. The outage will affect 5% of daily global oil output.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pinned the strikes directly on Iran. Tehran has dismissed the claim.

“Oil prices will jump on this attack,” said Jason Bordoff, founding director, Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. “The risk of tit-for-tat regional escalation that pushes oil prices even higher has gone up significantly.”

The International Energy Agency said it was in touch with Saudi authorities. “For now, markets are well supplied with ample commercial stocks,” it said.

This ruling was set to have an enormous impact because the incumbent President of Malawi Bingu wa Mutharika formed his Democratic Progressive Party as a split from the United Democratic Front after the last election, meaning that if Chimango expelled most of the DPP lawmakers, Mutharika would lose his majority in the National Assembly, making a move to impeach him very likely.

The president started ruling by decree on 1 August, ordering the allocation of funds in lieu of an actual budget. The SADC Parliamentary Forum has suggested it would be willing to mediate in the crisis. On August 7, the chief justice of the Supreme Court issued an injunction allowing the opposition MPs to continue blocking the budget. Critics have asserted that it would take half a year to organise the large number of by-elections which would ensue if all MPs who had crossed the floor were expelled. The injunction was lifted on 8 August, after public protests ensued. On 14 August, Mutharika set a deadline of two days for the parliament to discuss the budget, threatening to ""close down parliament"" otherwise.

WeWork founder Adam Neumann's loss of control of the company shows what happens when a leader lacks self-awareness and few around him are willing to speak the truth. Instead of leading his company into one of the most anticipated initial public offerings (IPO) of the year, Neumann has been demoted to non-executive chairman and lost control.

Neumann may have thought his success in launching WeWork, as evidenced by an astronomical pre-IPO valuation of $47 billion in January, exempted him from the rules that apply to everyone else. The 40-year-old executive may have believed it was really all about him — ironic, for a company called ""We.""

In the end, that was his undoing. Neumann stepped down as CEO and lost his controlling interest of We, parent of the shared office space startup he founded nine years ago that scaled to more than 100 cities in 29 countries.

SoftBank Group of Japan, the biggest investor in WeWork's parent, reportedly led the drive to replace Neumann as the company's estimated valuation shrank to as low as $10 billion and questions were raised over its governance. His wife, Rebekah, is also reportedly stepping down from her various roles, including CEO of WeGrow, the company's educational arm. Now, Neumann joins the ranks of disgraced founders, among them Uber's Travis Kalanick. This becomes a warning to founders of other startups: no matter how brilliant the idea or successful the company, you can't lose sight of reality.

Any one of Neumann's reported actions would have led to serious questions about the leader's fiduciary responsibility and fitness to lead a publicly traded company. But Neumann was apparently still under the impression that, as head of a private company, he could get away with bad behavior.

While it's true that there may not be as much visibility within a private company, Neumann was entering the public realm with the planned IPO. That means multiple stakeholders — and no secrets. With the public realm comes the oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and regulatory disclosure such as Sarbanes-Oxley, as well as an audit committee and a compensation committee composed of solely independent directors. These checks and balances are required of a publicly traded company in which the CEO and the board have a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, and compensation and perks for the CEO and other senior executives must be disclosed in detail in the proxy statement.

For a leader who isn't self-aware, the perceived privilege of living the high life can bring a warped sense of security that their actions aren't visible and therefore they're not accountable. It's like standing on Wrigley Field under the cover of darkness, thinking that you're invisible. Then suddenly someone flips the switch and you're under the glare of the floodlights — every move you make is scrutinized. That's what it's like to be the CEO of a public company who is answerable to numerous stakeholders.

This visibility makes it imperative for leaders to be values-based with a commitment to do the right thing, even when that requires a counterintuitive approach. One of the best examples is Rick Waddell, who was just three months into his job as CEO of Northern Trust Corporation when the financial crisis hit. The bank took actions to protect clients from the brunt of the crisis, including to purchase some illiquid securities from clients so these individuals would not suffer a cash crunch. Taking the high road did have its costs, but over the long run, the decision to protect clients paid off favorably with investors, who saw the bank as a safe haven.

Is Neumann surprised that it came to this?

After Neumann's departure from running the company, reports of paring staff, selling a private jet, and shedding other assets raises questions about why the WeWork valuation was so high in the first place. Earlier this month, We said it was postponing its IPO until later in the year.

In a statement, Neumann said that ""while our business has never been stronger, in recent weeks, the scrutiny directed toward me has become a significant distraction, and I have decided that it is in the best interest of the company to step down as chief executive."" Whether the decision was really his or, as reports indicate, he succumbed to pressure, one has to wonder: Is Neumann surprised that it came to this?

A healthy dose of self-awareness and having personal advisors may have made him more aware of the impact of his behavior. The foundation of values-based leadership is self-reflection — to constantly examine one's decisions, actions, and behaviors and weigh them against one's values. Without self-reflection, it's far too easy to get led astray with rationalization or a chorus of ""yes people"" who aren't willing to speak up about their concerns.

That's a lesson that Neumann is learning now, the hard way.

A rebel alliance of British lawmakers has voted to seize control of the parliamentary agenda, inflicting a humiliating defeat on Prime Minister Boris Johnson and threatening to derail his Brexit plans.

The government lost by 328 votes to 301, prompting Johnson to immediately announce that he would seek an election rather than be forced to request another “pointless delay” to the Brexit process.

The cross-party group of rebels will try to push through a bill on Wednesday that will prevent the UK leaving the EU on October 31 without a deal. The Prime Minister, meanwhile, will challenge the opposition Labour Party to vote in favor of a general election.

“Let there be no doubt about the consequences of this vote tonight. It means that parliament is on the brink of wrecking any deal we might be able to strike in Brussels,” Johnson told the House of Commons moments after the vote was announced.

In an extraordinary purge, the 21 Conservative lawmakers who voted in favor of the measure were booted out of the parliamentary party. Kenneth Clarke, who has been a Conservative lawmaker for 49 years, told the BBC he was sanguine about the decision. Clarke said his party had been taken over by extremists: “Anyone who who comes up to me and tells me I’m not a Conservative is taking an odd political view. It’s the Brexit Party rebadged.”

Other prominent lawmakers to be fired included former finance minister Philip Hammond, and the grandson of Winston Churchill, Nicholas Soames. “I knew what I was doing,” Soames told the Newsnight program. The move detonated the Conservative Party’s parliamentary majority, which dropped to zero earlier in the day when an MP defected to a rival party in dramatic fashion.

In an orchestrated move, Phillip Lee defected to the Liberal Democrats just as Johnson began his address the House on Tuesday afternoon.

Members of Parliament opposed to Britain crashing out of the EU – as Johnson has threatened to do – triggered the drama on Tuesday, lawmakers’ first day back after the summer break.

Johnson has been adamant he does not want to take the possibility of no-deal Brexit off the table. He believes the threat of no-deal makes his negotiation position stronger. Leaving without an agreement would be hugely disruptive for the British economy, but it would also hurt the rest of the EU, he argued.

Addressing the House of Commons, shouting to be heard over jeers of “sham” and “resign,” Johnson condemned the legislation aimed at blocking a no-deal Brexit, saying it would “force me to go to Brussels and beg [for] an extension” and “destroy any chance” of negotiating a new agreement.

“It would enable our friends in Brussels to dictate the terms of the negotiation. That’s what it does,” Johnson said.

The bill, backed by a cross-party group of politicians, would send Johnson to Brussels in order to seek an extension to the Brexit process until January 2020 if he failed to agree a new deal with the EU at a summit scheduled for mid-October.

The Prime Minister claims he been trying to renegotiate the withdrawal deal agreed with the EU by his predecessor Theresa May, demanding the removal of the so-called Irish backstop.

The clause is designed to prevent the reintroduction of border infrastructure between the Republic of Ireland, which will continue being an EU member, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK. The EU has so far refused, saying Johnson has not been able to offer a workable alternative.

In his speech on Tuesday, Johnson said that his government had made progress to this end – progress the bill would obliterate.

But opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned Johnson’s characterization of those negotiations with the EU, saying the government’s only strategy so far has been to “run down the clock.”

“The Prime Minister may claim progress has been made, but EU leaders report that the government has so far failed to present any new proposals,” Corbyn said.

“It’s becoming increasingly clear that his reckless government only has one plan, to crash out of the EU without a deal.”",0.029496352413019,0.4720608866442199,0.111,0.826,0.063,-0.9866,True,"The article appears to be a factual report of a significant event in British politics, specifically the attempt by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to block a bill aimed at preventing a no-deal Brexit and the subsequent rebellion by lawmakers.

These dismissals were followed by the resignations of three more cabinet ministers and another parliamentary secretary, in sympathy with those dismissed. Initially, this only left the President and one other minister in post, although one of those who had resigned rescinded his resignation within a few hours. The reasons that the ex-ministers put forward for the confrontation and subsequent resignations were the autocratic attitude of Banda, who failed to consult other ministers and kept power in his own hands, his insistence on maintaining diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal and a number of domestic austerity measures. It is unclear whether the former ministers intended to remove Banda entirely, to reduce his role to that of a non-executive figurehead or simply to force him to recognise collective cabinet responsibility. Banda seized the initiative, firstly, by dismissing some of the dissidents rather than negotiating, and secondly, (after the resignations) by holding a debate on a motion of confidence on 8 and 9 September 1964. As the result of the debate was an overwhelming vote of confidence, Banda declined to reinstate any of the ministers or offer them any other posts, despite the urging of the Governor-General to compromise. After some unrest, and clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and of Banda, most of the former left Malawi in October with their families and leading supporters, for Zambia or Tanzania. One ex-minister, Henry Chipembere went into hiding inside Malawi and, in February 1965 led a small, unsuccessful armed uprising. After its failure, he was able to arrange for his transfer to the USA. Another ex-minister, Yatuta Chisiza, organised an even smaller incursion from Mozambique in 1967, in which he was killed.

The coup leaders were hard-line members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) who were opposed to Gorbachev\'s reform program and the new union treaty that he had negotiated which decentralised much of the central government\'s power to the republics. They were opposed, mainly in Moscow, by a short but effective campaign of civil resistance led by Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who had been both an ally and critic of Gorbachev. Although the coup collapsed in only two days and Gorbachev returned to government, the event destabilised the Soviet Union and is widely considered to have contributed to both the demise of the CPSU and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.']"

After lifting a sixth European title last season, and enthralling fans with swashbuckling football, Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool side has provided seven players on the 55-man FIFPro World XI shortlist.

Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson, Allison Becker and Trent Alexander-Arnold were all selected for consideration from votes compiled from about 65,000 professional footballers worldwide.

Every year since 2005, one goalkeeper, four defenders, three midfielders and three forwards have been honored in the World XI, organized by FIFPro – the International Federation of Professional Footballers. This year, England-based players are back on top.

The seven Reds join eight players from Manchester City, three from Tottenham Hotspur and two each from Manchester United and Chelsea as the Premier League edges out the Spanish Liga 21-20 as the best represented league on the list. This is the first time since 2009 that the English league has contributed the most players.

Raheem Sterling, Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero standout from an impressive cast supplied English Premier League champion Manchester City.

Tottenham Hotspur, defeated 2-0 by Liverpool in last season’s Champions League final, is represented by Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen – the first Dane on the list – and Son Heung-Min, who is the first player from Asia to make the 55.

Spain’s pain

Spain’s nine-year reign as the highest contributor to the list may have ended, with 20 players included, but Real Madrid and Barcelona continue to dominate when it comes to individual clubs.

Barca has nine players shortlisted with representatives in all positions. If you include two of its recent recruits in Frenkie de Jong and Antoine Griezmann, who joined from Ajax Amsterdam and Atletico Madrid respectively, the Spanish giant could field a complete team.

Real has fallen short of its fierce rivals with eight players on the list. Sergio Ramos, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric have all been recognised, as has Eden Hazard, who joined from Chelsea over the summer for a reported fee of $113 million.

On the women’s shortlist, 14 of the World Cup-winning USA squad are included. Captain Megan Rapinoe leads a stellar group that includes enough names to field a full team with reserves to spare.

Epstein hobnobbed with world leaders and elite executives throughout his life, even after he registered as a sex offender as part of a guilty plea in 2008. He's been connected to everyone from Prince Andrew to L Brands CEO Les Wexner to several tech moguls, including Elon Musk and Bill Gates.

Their findings were announced in a press conference and the online publication of a scientific paper on 19 May 2009.', 'Mary Leakey | Mary Leakey, FBA (6 February 1913 – 9 December 1996) was a British paleoanthropologist who discovered the first fossilised ""Proconsul"" skull, an extinct ape which is now believed to be ancestral to humans. She also discovered the robust ""Zinjanthropus"" skull at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, eastern Africa. For much of her career she worked with her husband, Louis Leakey, at Olduvai Gorge, where they uncovered fossils of ancient hominines and the earliest hominins, as well as the stone tools produced by the latter group. Mary Leakey developed a system for classifying the stone tools found at Olduvai. She discovered the Laetoli footprints, and at the Laetoli site she discovered hominin fossils that were more than 3.75 million years old.', 'Ailuropoda microta | Ailuropoda microta is the earliest known ancestor of the giant panda. It measured 1 m (3 ft) in length; the modern giant panda grows to a size in excess of 1.5 m (5 ft). Wear patterns on its teeth suggest it lived on a diet of bamboo, the primary food of the giant panda. The first discovered skull of the animal in a south China limestone cave is estimated to be 2 million years old. The skull found is about half the size of a modern-day giant panda, but is anatomically very similar. This research suggests that the giant panda has evolved for more than three million years as a completely separate lineage from that of other bears.', 'K. Christopher Beard | K. Christopher Beard is an American paleontologist, a world-renowned expert on the primate fossil record and a 2000 MacArthur Fellowship “Genius” Award Winner.

Dr. Beard is the former Curator of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and Mary R. Dawson Chair of Vertebrate Paleontology, at University of Pittsburgh. He is currently Distinguished Foundation Professor, Senior Curator at the University of Kansas. He was co-author with Dan Gebo about an extinct primate from China. Dr. Beard also authored the book The Hunt for the Dawn Monkey: Unearthing the Origins of Monkeys, Apes and Humans. Beard was also part of the research teams that discovered Teilhardina, the earliest primate ever found in North America, and Eosimias, one of the earliest higher primates yet discovered. He worked with NASA to scan a ""Tyrannosaurus rex"" skull. Beard received his PhD from the Functional Anatomy and Evolution Program at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in 1989.', 'Grimaldi Man | Grimaldi man was a name given in the early 20th century to an Italian find of two paleolithic skeletons. When found, the skeletons were the subject of dubious scientific theories on human evolution, partly fueled by biased reconstruction of the skulls by the scientists involved. While the skeletons differ markedly from the contemporary Cro-Magnon finds from other parts of Europe, the Grimaldi find, together with various other finds of early modern humans, was classified as Cro-Magnon (in the wider sense) in the 1960s, though the term European early modern humans is today preferred for this assemblage.']"

Former Vice President Joe Biden is preparing for a lengthy Democratic primary battle despite his status as the front-runner in national polls, senior campaign aides said Tuesday.

Biden could withstand a loss in Iowa because of his strength among minority voters in the more diverse states that follow it in the presidential nominating process, the aides said.

“We expect this to be a fight. We expect this to go for a while,” a senior campaign aide said during a call briefing reporters on Biden’s approach to the campaign this fall.

“Do we think we have to win Iowa? No. Do we want to win Iowa? Yes, we do,” the aide said. “We think we’re going to win; we know it’s going to be a dogfight. The same thing is true in New Hampshire.”

The aide said Biden’s campaign believes there will be “three or four” Democrats going deep into the race – specifically pointing to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as unlikely to depart early.

The comments are another indication that, though Biden for months has led national polls, the early-voting states – particularly Iowa and New Hampshire, where the electorates are whiter and organizing is key – present a unique challenge. His aides argued that Biden will be stronger in Nevada and South Carolina, the more diverse third and fourth states to vote, as well as on Super Tuesday.

“There is no way, no reason, that the nominee of this party should be decided before Nevada and South Carolina vote,” the aide said.

“We are now ramping up not just for Super Tuesday, but Super Tuesday and beyond. … We have no expectation, nor should anyone else, that this is going to end quickly after the first four, nor should it. I can’t see Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or others getting out. No one should expect us to, and we feel we’re going to be in a very dominant spot when all these different states get a chance to vote.”

Biden’s aides emphasized that he is the only candidate in the Democratic race with a diverse coalition of supporters – implying that the leading progressive contenders, Warren and Sanders, have so far failed to win over black and Latino voters.

A late-August Quinnipiac poll of Democratic primary voters in which Biden led nationally with 32% support to Warren’s 19% and Sanders’ 15% showed Biden with 46% support among black voters compared to 30% among white voters. Warren, meanwhile, was backed by 23% of white voters but 10% of black voters; Sanders saw a less stark drop in support from 14% of white voters to 10% of black voters.

“The Democratic Party is more than Twitter,” a senior aide said. “And it’s more than just a slice of the ideological spectrum. The Democratic Party represents a lot of interests. It’s older than people want to admit sometimes. It’s more ideologically diverse.”

His aides also downplayed the narrative of a Biden vs. Warren head-to-head contest.

That the two will stand on a debate stage next to each other for the first time in Houston next week is “is really irrelevant to the case that he’s making directly to voters,” a second senior campaign aide said.

Asked about areas of weakness, a Biden aide said the campaign is “not as strong among younger voters.” The same Quinnipiac poll showed Biden supported by just 10% of those between the ages of 18 and 34.

The aide identified gun control as among the most important issues to those younger voters, and said Biden has “the strongest record and case to make on guns.”

A senior Biden aide said the campaign believes that gaffes that receive press coverage are not damaging the former vice president with voters because “they know him, they trust him, they believe in him.”

It sounds like Kylie Jenner wants everyone to calm down.

Amid reports that she and rapper Travis Scott have split after two years and speculation that she’s rekindled things with her ex, rapper Tyga, Jenner is speaking out.

“The internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is,” Jenner tweeted Thursday.

“There was no ‘2am date with Tyga,’” she wrote. “You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at.”

The makeup mogul had dated the rapper prior to starting a relationship with Scott.

She and Scott are the parents of daughter, Stormi, whom they welcomed in February 2018.

The couple began dating in April 2017.

“Travis and i are on great terms and our main focus right now is Stormi!!,” Jenner tweeted. “Our friendship and our daughter is priority.”

In the recent Playboy Pleasure Issue, Scott, 28, interviewed Jenner, 22, and talk turned to their relationship.

Boaz Weinstein's latest activism campaign in closed-end funds has affiliates of the $750 billion asset manager Legg Mason on opposite sides of the proxy fight.

Weinstein's Saba Capital, a $1.7 billion hedge fund, is trying to place new board members on two funds run by Western Asset Management, which is owned by the Baltimore-based Legg: the $679 million Western Global High Income fund and the $891 million Western High Income fund.

The fight between the two sides has included the sharp elbows and choice words common of activist campaigns — Western wrote to the stockholders of the Global High Income fund that the fund ""is simply the latest fund that [Saba] is targeting for a quick profit.""

""Saba Capital has engaged in 16 proxy contests since its inception in 2009 and currently maintains minimal to no holdings in many of the funds it has previously targeted,"" the letter reads in bold print. Saba, in its Securities and Exchange Commission filing announcing the stake it took in the funds, wrote that Western's board structure — which Saba says protects incumbents — ""is strong proof that the board is not acting in the best interests of its shareholders.""

But what is unique to this fight is that those would stand to benefit from a Saba victory include investor EnTrust Global, a $20 billion fund of hedge funds that is owned by Legg Mason.

Saba's campaigns led to a legal fight with BlackRock, and Neuberger Berman has said that Saba's activism violates the decades-long law that governs retail funds, but this is the first time Weinstein has gotten support from one side of a manager and pushback from another.

In a statement, Legg Mason said that its affiliates were free to invest in what they believe is the best option for their clients.

Political protest was not tolerated and human rights groups accused Ben Ali's regime of unfairly arresting and mistreating political dissidents.

Under the surface, there was resentment against the perceived corruption surrounding the ruling elite, some of which was detailed in US diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks at the end of 2010.

Ben Ali was married twice with six children. His second wife, Leila Trabelsi, played a prominent role in Tunisian public life and reportedly helped amass huge economic holdings for her extended family.

With no obvious rivals to Ben Ali, there was speculation that he was looking to pass on power to one of his relatives.

In the final days of 2010, a series of protests began in the centre of the country after a young graduate set himself on fire when stopped from selling fruit and vegetables without a licence.

The protests, advertised widely through social media networks, gradually spread.

Ben Ali initially blamed the demonstrations on a fringe of ""extremists"". But he changed tack on 13 January, expressing deep regrets for the deaths of protesters, pledging to introduce media freedoms, and promising not to stand in 2014.

But his offer of concessions failed to quell the unrest, and the following day, after huge crowds took to the streets of Tunis and clashed with the security forces once again, he fled the country for Saudi Arabia, where he died on 19 September 2019.

The latest Democratic debate threw up a rich haul of clashes, incidents, slow burning controversies and policy collisions that will help define the 2020 race in the weeks to come.

Often, a debate’s impact only becomes clear in subsequent days, when exchanges that did not immediately resonate take on extra significance as the churn of the campaign does its work.

Thursday’s encounter in Houston exposed ideological, personal and policy divisions between the candidates that offer clues about how the Democratic race will unfold from now on.

There’s a trove of material for each campaign to mine to tweak the weaknesses of rival candidates. And President Donald Trump’s team must have been watching with glee as comment on guns and health care piled up material for general election attack ads.

Over the span of this race, there’s little evidence that the debates are changing the hierarchy of candidates. But the confrontations are serving to expose the complex layers of the campaign and offer clues over how it may turn out.

The top tier may freeze in place

The debate solidified the clear top tier in this race and none of the leading candidates looks likely to quickly fade in the crucial run-up to the Iowa caucuses in February.

Former Vice President Joe Biden had a patchy night but Thursday was his best performance so far in his campaign. Sen. Elizabeth Warren was relatively quiet but made no huge mistakes. And Sen. Bernie Sanders will have delighted his solid supporters but did not seem to solve the riddle of broadening his base.

These three however have yet to turn their full fire on one another. That’s one thing to watch for as the race really gets going.

Outsider desperation

From here on in, the clock is ticking for everyone else.

Low polling candidates must elbow themselves into the top tier. Julian Castro’s unsubtle jabs at Biden’s age, Beto O’Rourke’s vow to confiscate assault rifles and an overt turn against Trump by Kamala Harris in a direct-to-camera stare down are a sure sign the pressure to stand out is beginning to show.

In the weeks to come, keeping the cash flowing will become even more important as candidates build early state machines and buy advertising. So they must show donors that they still have a shot and there’s a reason to go on. A metric of success for this debate will come in third quarter fund raising data at the end of the month.

Businessman Andrew Yang rolled out a novel way of getting some buzz, turning his campaign into a raffle to give 10 people $1000 a month for a year to highlight his universal basic income plan.

Biden and the age issue

Castro’s pile-on was clumsy. By repeatedly asking Biden: “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” the former HUD Secretary actually built empathy for the former vice president.

But make no mistake, many of the other candidates are happy this is out there and even happier that Castro stepped on the landmine before they had to – their post-debate interviews are proof of that.

“There’s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball across the end line without fumbling,” Booker told CNN’s Anderson Cooper after the debate. Harris was asked several times on “New Day” about the Castro assault, but pointedly chose not to criticize its author or to defend Biden.

The question of whether the former vice president is fit for the rigors of the presidency and to take on Trump is not going away. It’s one of his biggest weaknesses and, as even Biden has said, it’s fair game for opponents to explore. And Biden put it on the table himself by rooting his campaign in an argument about electability.

Any stumbles in the Democratic debate next month and the issue will be back on the front burner.

Moderates awake

The dominant narrative is that this race is taking Democrats, led by Sanders, Warren and the activist base, so far left that they risk alienating America’s political middle.

Biden, Harris, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and O’Rourke all had strong moments pushing a pragmatic brand of politics to reflect Washington realities.

Their strategy is likely to become a more overt theme in the contest as the first nominating voting looms.

The schism in the field is especially evident on health care – broadly over whether to build on Obamacare or to go all in on a Medicare for All push.

There are signs that Warren might be hedging her bets and trying to provide herself room to track back toward the center in a general election campaign. But her line that “I have never met anyone who likes their health insurance company” may put off Americans who don’t want to give up employer-provided plans.

It will certainly be highlighted by Trump if she ends up as his Democratic opponent and will reinforce claims by the moderates that progressives are leading Democrats into a dead end.

O’Rourke on guns: Brave move or historic error?

Another moment from Thursday sure to find its way into an attack ad is O’Rourke’s vow: “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.” His call for a mandatory guns buy back scheme was an impassioned reaction to a massacre in his home town of El Paso and a strategy designed to help his underperforming campaign grab the spotlight.

There’s an argument that gun politics is changing and Washington is yet to get the message. But O’Rourke also risks playing into GOP dogma that all gun control is a ruse for Democrats to confiscate the guns of law abiding Americans. It’s a base-stoking claim already burning up conservative media. And the eventual Democratic nominee will have to repeatedly answer for O’Rourke’s comment.

One prominent Democrat is already mad at O’Rourke.

“I frankly think that that clip will be played for years at Second Amendment rallies with organizations that try to scare people by saying, ‘Democrats are coming for your guns,’” Delaware Sen. Chris Coons said Friday on CNN’s “Newsroom.”

The Trump in the room

The Democratic debate at times seemed from another era. Candidates earnestly clashing over policy, pursuing traditional political attacks and firing off pre-planned zingers.

Trump blew up such conventional political codes in destroying the GOP field in 2016. Assuming he shows up for presidential debates next fall, whoever emerges from the Democratic race will have to deal with the President’s brawling, outlandish style.

While Democrats were quarreling over the nuances of health care, Trump counter-programmed with a whirling campaign pitch at a Republican retreat in Baltimore. He vented against bans of plastic straws, complained about energy saving light bulbs Trump claimed made him look orange and included a bizarre aside about Republican House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy.

“Kevin is just like a cow, he’s just smaller,” Trump said.

Overall, the Democratic presidential race marks an implicit bet that Americans are tired of Trump’s act – and that offering clear plans on issues like health care is an antidote to the craziness that rocks the White House every day.

Biden has made the most obvious pitch so far for the role of Trump slayer. Harris joined the game on Thursday night meaning that the question of electability will be increasingly important in the weeks to come.",0.0927098978119386,0.4324382675147982,0.087,0.806,0.108,0.9776,True,"This article appears to be a genuine report on the 2020 Democratic debate, analyzing the performances of the candidates, their policies, and the potential implications for the election.

This mouse strain has been a useful model of hereditary tyrosinemia, a human genetic disease caused by inactivating mutations in the ""Fah"" gene.

In this context the survival and growth of cells able to contribute to liver function is positively selected, because the mutant hepatocytes in the recipient are unable to divide and are functionally impaired. The transplantation of cells to Fah-deficient mice has been and continues to be a critical test of hepatocyte-like function. In addition, it has been a useful model for gene therapy; if the mutated ""Fah"" gene is be repaired or replaced in a sufficient number of cells, liver function is restored.

The poop-testing startup uBiome is facing yet another setback a day after filing for bankruptcy.

The massive pharmacy chain CVS Health has decided it won't stock uBiome's testing kits in its stores, according to a CVS spokesman. uBiome was counting on selling the kits in CVS stores as part of a plan to get a fresh start and demonstrate to potential acquirers that the company still has value.

""Simply put, uBiome needs a clean slate and a fresh start to save the business and 100 jobs,"" uBiome acting CEO Curtis Solsvig said in a court document.

uBiome didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company said in its bankruptcy filing that it hoped to entice an investor to purchase it for its scientific knowledge of the microbiome, the trillions of bacteria that live in and on our bodies. uBiome said it had approached 180 potential acquirers but couldn't seal a deal. Potential uBiome buyers face risks that include civil and criminal penalties resulting from ongoing investigations into uBiome's business practices, the document said.

Volodymyr Zelensky may have been swept into the center of a major political storm in Washington, but the Ukrainian President still made some time to meet Hollywood A-lister Tom Cruise this week.

Zelensky hosted Cruise in his office in Kiev on Monday evening, his administration said in a statement.

“At the invitation of President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, the world-famous American actor, film director and producer Tom Cruise arrived in Kiev,” the administration said Tuesday.

A short video clip from the meeting showed Zelensky, a former actor himself, shaking Cruise’s hand. “You’re good looking … like in a movie,” the president could be heard telling the actor.

“It pays the rent,” Cruise responded, much to the laughter of those present.

Cruise told Zelensky he was interested in scouting film locations in Ukraine. In the video, Cruise mentions seeing cobbled streets.

Zelensky also mentioned his own experiences in the industry and expressed hope that Ukraine would become an attractive destination for filmmakers, the statement said.

“Zelensky also noted that the Ukrainian Parliament recently passed a law on compensation for foreign filmmakers in Ukraine,” the statement read.

It wasn’t all movie talk though. In the clip, Zelensky is heard telling the actor about the Minsk process, referring to the agreement signed in 2015 that called for a ceasefire in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. That accord called for the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the region but has repeatedly been breached.

In recent days, Zelensky has found himself in the international spotlight after a phone conversation with Donald Trump prompted a whistleblower complaint that led to an impeachment inquiry against the US President.

When California legalized marijuana in 2016, Ingrid Archie celebrated.

Then it was time to file paperwork.

Ms. Archie was among the thousands of Californians eligible to have cannabis-related convictions reduced or cleared from their records under provisions of the new law that not only made the possession of marijuana legal, it also mandated that penalties for minor offenses that were no longer crimes be retroactively eliminated and that some other convictions be reduced.

Those provisions have been hailed by criminal justice experts as a sign of California’s progress when it comes to criminal justice reforms and are intended to correct for years of disproportionate arrests and convictions for drug offenses, particularly in black and Latino communities.

The nagging problem has been how to implement such sweeping reforms.

Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris has called on Twitter to suspend its most high-profile user: President Donald Trump.

In a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey dated Tuesday, Harris pointed to six tweets Trump has sent since last Friday that Harris says violated Twitter’s rules.

Harris said that Trump has used his account to “target, harass, and attempt to out the whistleblower” whose allegations about Trump’s call with the leader of Ukraine prompted Democrats to launch an impeachment inquiry.

“President Trump also published the following tweet suggesting that violence could be incited should Congress issue formal articles of impeachment against him,” she wrote, highlighting a tweet Trump sent on Sunday that read: “….If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.” The tweet was a selective quote of a supporter on Fox News.

Harris also pointed to tweets Trump sent that said Rep. Adam Schiff should be “questions at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.”

“These are blatant threats,” Harris wrote to Dorsey, “We need a civil society, not a civil war.”

Harris pointed to how Twitter previously banned high-profile users from its platform, like the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.

“No user, regardless of their job, wealth, or stature should be exempt from abiding by Twitter’s user agreement, not even the President of the United States,” she wrote.

A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to CNN on Wednesday that company received the letter and intends to respond.

Twitter announced in June that some tweets from world leaders that break its rules would not be removed from the platform if the company decided they were in the “public interest.” Twitter said it would instead put a disclaimer on the tweets explaining that although they broke the company’s rules they would not be removed.

Twitter has not labeled any of Trump’s tweets in this way.

The state funeral in the capital on Saturday followed a week of disputes between the Mugabe family and the government over where the former president will be laid to rest.

Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years until he was forced to resign in the wake of a military coup in November 2017, died last week in a Singapore hospital at the age of 95.

Ruling ZANU-PF party and President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Mugabe’s former deputy who helped remove him from power, wanted him to be buried at a national monument to heroes of the liberation war against white minority rule. But some relatives, expressing bitterness at the way former comrades had deposed Mugabe, pushed for him to be buried in his ancestral village of Kutama.

The two parties on Friday finally agreed he should lie at National Heroes Acre in Harare. The burial will take place in about 30 days, once a new mausoleum has been built for him there.

Al Jazeera’s Haru Mutasa, reporting from the stadium in the capital, said the wrangling over Mugabe’s burial exposed the deep divisions in the country over his legacy.

“People who love Mugabe are saying that is a great idea, that it is a great way to honour him,” she said, referring to the burial at National Heroes Acre.

“Some Zimbabweans are saying officials knew that Mugabe was going to die at some point, so why didn’t they build the mausoleum earlier?” she added.

“Many others are asking who is going to pay for this? Is it going to be the Mugabe family or is it going to be taxpayers’ money? If it is taxpayers, how much is it going to cost? It could cost millions of Zimbabwean dollars, money that could be better spent elsewhere like in public hospitals where there is a lack of essential drugs.”

Mugabe was feted as a champion of racial reconciliation when he came to power in 1980 in one of the last African states to throw off white colonial rule.

By the time he was forced to step down in 2017 to wild celebrations across the country of 13 million, he was viewed by many at home and abroad as a power-obsessed leader who unleashed death squads, rigged elections and ruined the economy to keep control.

‘Today Africa weeps’

Former and current African leaders, including South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa and Kenya’s Uhuru Kenyatta, arrived for Saturday’s ceremony to crowds chanting and drumming liberation songs at the 60,000-capacity national stadium in Harare.

Mugabe’s coffin, draped in the green, black, gold and red Zimbabwean flag, was marched slowly into the stadium, which was only half-full, accompanied by a military band and an escort of officers. His wife, Grace, in a black veil, and family followed behind.

In his tribute to Mugabe, Mnangagwa said his predecessor stood in defence of Africans. He also urged the West to remove sanctions that were imposed during Mugabe’s rule.

“We who remain shall continue to hear his rich, brave, defiant and inspiring voice … encouraging and warning us to be vigilant and astute,” Mnangagwa said in a speech.

“A giant tree of Africa has fallen. Today Africa weeps.”

Kenyatta meanwhile described Mugabe as “a great icon of African liberation” and “a visionary leader and relentless champion of African dignity”.

Ramaphosa, for his part, drew boos from the crowd, angered by recent attacks on foreigners in South Africa, in which Zimbabweans were targeted. An official had to plead with the crowd to let him speak. Ramaphosa apologised for the attacks.

Banners reading “Hamba kahle, Gushungo,” (go well, Gushungo) in reference to Mugabe’s clan name and “Pioneer of nationalist politics,” were on display at the stadium before the state funeral.

“I feel low because Mugabe fought for us. I remember him for [giving] land to the blacks, economic freedom and higher education which was non-racial,” Cleo Mapuranga, a caterer, told Reuters news agency.

“Now, people are suffering. No one is controlling the prices in the shops. Our finance minister is trying to implement first-world policies which don’t work in third-world countries.” Mapuranga added.
